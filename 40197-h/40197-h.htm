<h2><a name="THE_COUNTRY-LIFE" id="THE_COUNTRY-LIFE"></a>THE COUNTRY-LIFE
MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>The country-life movement is the working
out of the desire to make rural civilization as
effective and satisfying as other civilization.</p>

<p>It is not an organized movement proceeding
from one center or even expressing one set of
ideas. It is a world-motive to even up society
as between country and city; for it is generally
understood that country life has not reached as
high development within its sphere as city life
has reached within its sphere.</p>

<p>We call it a new subject. As a "movement,"
or a recognized set of problems needing attention,
it may possibly be called new; but in
reality it is new only to those who have recently
discovered it.</p>


<h3><a name="It_is_not_a_back-to-the-land_movement"
id="It_is_not_a_back-to-the-land_movement"></a><i>
It is not a back-to-the-land movement.</i></h3>

<p>The country-life movement must be sharply
distinguished from the present popular back-to-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>the-land
agitation. The latter is primarily
a city or town impulse, expressing the desire
of townspeople to escape, or of cities to find
relief, or of real estate dealers to sell land;
and in part it is the result of the doubtful
propaganda to decrease the cost of living by
sending more persons to the land, on the
mostly mistaken assumption that more products
will thereby be secured for the world's
markets.</p>

<p>The back-to-the-land agitation is not necessarily
to be discouraged, yet we are not to expect
more of it than it can accomplish; but whatever
the outward movement to the land may be, the
effort to effectualize rural society, for the people
who now comprise this society, is one of the
fundamental problems now before the people.</p>

<p>The country-life and back-to-the-land movements
are not only little related, but in many
ways they are distinctly antagonistic.</p>


<h3><a name="This_book" id="This_book"></a><i>This book.</i></h3>

<p>The foregoing paragraphs indicate the subject
of this book. I mean only to express opinions
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
 a few of the questions that are popularly
under discussion, or that are specially important
at this time. I shall present no studies, and I
intend to follow no systematic course. Some
of these subjects I have already discussed with
the public, but they may now have new expression
or relations.</p>

<p>The lack of adjustment between city and
country must be remedied, but the remedies
lie in fundamental processes and not in the
treatment of symptoms. Undoubtedly very
much can be done to even up the economic
situation and the distribution of population;
and this needs careful and continuous study by
commissions or other agencies created for the
purpose. We are scarcely in sight of the good
that such agencies could accomplish. I hope
that this book may suggest some of the things
to be considered. The past century belonged
to the city; the present century should belong
also to agriculture and the open country.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_NATIONAL_MOVEMENT" id="THE_NATIONAL_MOVEMENT"></a>THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>The present revival of rural interest is immediately
an effort to improve farming; but at
bottom it is a desire to stimulate new activity
in a more or less stationary phase of civilization.
We may over-exploit the movement, but it is
sound at the center. For the next twenty-five
years we may expect it to have great influence
on the course of events, for it will require this
length of time to balance up society. Politicians
will use it as a means of riding into power.
Demagogues and fakirs will take advantage of
it for personal gain. Tradesmen will make
much of it. Writers are even now beginning
to sensationalize it.</p>

<p>But there will also arise countrymen with
statesmanship in them; if not so, then we cannot
make the progress that we need. The movement
will have its significant political aspect,
and we may look for governors of states and
perhaps more than one President of the United
States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
 to come out of it. In the end, the
farmer controls the politics because he makes the
crops on which the wealth of the country depends.
There is probably a greater proportion
of tax-payers among voting farmers than among
city people.</p>

<p>Considered in total results, educational and
political as well as social and economic, the
country-life movement in North America is
probably farther advanced than in any other
part of the world. It may not have such striking
manifestations in some special lines, and
our people may not need so much as other
peoples that these particular lines be first or
most strongly attacked. The movement really
has been under way for many years, but it has
only recently found separate expression. Most
of the progress has been fundamental, and will
not need to be done over again. The movement
is well afoot among the country people
themselves, and they are doing some of the
clearest thinking on the situation. Many of
our own people do not know how far we have
already come.</p>

<a name="A_transition_period" id="A_transition_period"></a>
<i>A transition period.</i></h3>

<p>Such undercurrent movements are usually
associated with transition epochs. In parts of
the Old World the nexus in the social structure
has been the landlord, and the change in land-tenure
systems has made a social reorganization
necessary. There is no political land-tenure
problem in the United States, and therefore
there is no need, on that score, of the co√∂peration
of small owners or would-be owners to
form a new social crystallization. But there
is a land problem with us, nevertheless, and
this is at the bottom of our present movement:
it is the immanent problem of remaining more
or less stationary on our present lands, rather
than moving on to untouched lands, when
the ready-to-use fertility is reduced. We have
had a new-land society, with all the marks of
expansion and shift. We are now coming to
a new era; but, unlike new eras in some other
countries, it is not complicated by hereditary
social stratification. Our real agricultural development
will now begin.</p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
 the discussion of these rural interests,
old foundations and old ideas in all probability
will be torn up. We shall probably discard
many of the notions that now are new and
that promise well. We may face trying situations,
but something better will come out
of it. It is now a time to be conservative
and careful, and to let the movement mature.</p>


<h3><a name="The_commission_on_country_life"
id="The_commission_on_country_life"></a><i>The commission on country life.</i></h3>

<p>The first organized expression of the country-life
movement in the United States was the
appointment of the Commission on Country
Life by President Roosevelt in August, 1908.
It was a Commission of exploration and suggestion.
It could make no scientific studies
of its own within the time at its command,
but it could put the situation before the people.
President Roosevelt saw the country-life problem
and attacked it.</p>

<p>The Commission made its Report to the
President early in 1909. It found the general
level of country life in the United States to be
good as compared with that of any previous
time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
 but yet "that agriculture is not commercially
as profitable as it is entitled to be for
the labor and energy that the farmer expends
and the risks that he assumes, and that the
social conditions in the open country are far
short of their possibilities."</p>

<p>A dozen large reasons for this state of affairs,
a state that directly curtails the efficiency of the
nation, are given in the Report; and it suggests
many remedies that can be set in motion by
Congress, states, communities, and individuals.
The three "great movements of the utmost
consequence that should be set under way at
the earliest possible time, because they are fundamental
to the whole problem of ultimate permanent
reconstruction" are: taking inventory
of country life by means of "an exhaustive
study or survey of all the conditions that surround
the business of farming and the people
who live in the country, in order to take
stock of our resources and to supply the farmer
with local knowledge"; the organizing of a
nationalized extension work; the inauguration
of a general campaign of rural progress.</p>

<p>It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
 is suggested that Congress provide "some
means or agency for the guidance of public
opinion toward the development of a real rural
society that shall rest directly on the land."</p>

<p>The Report of the Commission on Country
Life makes no discussion of the city-to-country
movement.</p>

<p>The Report recognizes the fundamental importance
of the agricultural experiment stations
and of the great chain of land-grant
colleges and of government departments and of
other agencies; and the work that it proposes
is intended to be supplementary to them.</p>


<h3><a name="The_three_fundamental_recommendations_of_the_Commission"
id="The_three_fundamental_recommendations_of_the_Commission"></a>
<i>The three fundamental recommendations of
the Commission.</i></h3>

<p>The taking stock of the exact condition and
materials of country life is immensely important,
for we cannot apply remedies before we
make a diagnosis, and an accurate diagnosis
must rest on a multitude of facts that we do
not now possess. This is the scientific rather
than the doctrinaire, politics, and oracular
method of approaching the subject. It is of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
 first importance that we do not set out
on this new work with only general opinions
and superficial and fragmentary knowledge.
Every rural community needs to have a program
of its own carefully worked out, and
this program should rest on a physical valuation.
It may be some time yet before the
importance and magnitude of this undertaking
will impress the minds of the people,
but it is essential to the best permanent
progress.</p>

<p>Agricultural extension work of a well-organized
kind is now beginning to come out of
the colleges of agriculture, and this must be
extended and systematized so that, with other
agencies, it may reach every last man on the
land. A bill to set this work in motion is
now before Congress.</p>

<p>The third recommendation of the Commission
for immediate action is "the holding of
local, state, and even national conferences on
rural progress, designed to unite the interests
of education, organization, and religion into
one forward movement for the re-building of
country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
 life. Rural teachers, librarians, clergymen,
editors, physicians, and others may well
unite with farmers in studying and discussing
the rural question in all its aspects. We must
in some way unite all institutions, all organizations,
all individuals having any interest in
country life into one great campaign for rural
progress."</p>

<p>Conferences are now being held in many
parts of the Union by universities, colleges,
state departments of agriculture, chambers of
commerce, business organizations, and other
bodies. This will make public opinion. Such
conventions, discussing the larger social, political,
and economic relations of country life,
should now be held in every state and geographical
region.</p>

<p>It is now time that states undertake country-life
programs. There is still much attack of
symptoms; but persons in political offices, for
the most, are not yet well-enough informed to
make the most of the rural situation as it exists,
or to utilize to the best advantage the talent and
the institutions that the country now possesses.
One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
 has only to read the recommendations to
legislative bodies to recognize the relative lack
as yet of constructive plans for the improvement
of rural conditions.</p>


<h3><a name="A_national_conference_on_country_life"
id="A_national_conference_on_country_life"></a>
<i>A national conference on country life.</i></h3>

<p>If there should be state and local conferences
for country life, so also should there be
a national conference, meeting yearly. Such
a conference should not be an agricultural
convention in the ordinary sense, nor is it
necessary that it be held in commanding agricultural
regions. It should deal with the larger
affairs and relations in their applications to rural
civilization.</p>


<h3><a name="A_voluntary_movement"
id="A_voluntary_movement"></a><i>A voluntary movement.</i></h3>

<p>The interest in country life is gradually assuming
shape as a voluntary movement outside
of government, as it properly should do. It
should be in the best sense a popular movement;
for if it is not a really popular movement,
it can have little vitality, and exert little
effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
 on the mass of the people. As it gets
under motion, certain things will crystallize out
of it for government to do; and governments
will do them.</p>

<p>As a pure matter of propagation, such a
voluntary organized movement would have the
greatest value; for, in these days, simple publicity
often accomplishes more than legislative
action.</p>


<h3><a name="The_international_phase"
id="The_international_phase"></a><i>The international phase.</i></h3>

<p>If the interest in rural economics and sociology
is world wide, then we should have
international institutions to represent it. Several
organizations now represent or include certain
phases. We need such an institution not
so much for propaganda as for research. A
Country Life Institute has been proposed by
Sir Horace Plunkett, who is so well known
and admired by all students of rural situations
through his far-seeing work in Ireland and
his many fruitful suggestions for America. It
would seem that here is an unusual opportunity
for a great and productive foundation.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_INTER-RELATIONS_OF_CITY" id="SOME_INTER-RELATIONS_OF_CITY"></a>SOME INTER-RELATIONS OF CITY
AND COUNTRY</h2>


<p>Every one knows that city populations are
increasing more rapidly than country populations.
By some persons, this of itself is considered
to be a cause for much alarm. But the
relative size of the populations is not so disturbing
as the economic and social relations existing
between these two phases of civilization.</p>


<h3><a name="Some_contrasts_of_town_folk_and_country_folk"
id="Some_contrasts_of_town_folk_and_country_folk"></a>
<i>Some contrasts of town folk and country folk.</i></h3>

<p>We know that farming is the primitive and
underlying business of mankind. As human
desires have arisen, other occupations have
developed to satisfy the increasing needs and
aspirations, the products of the earth have
been assembled and changed by manufacture
into a thousand forms, and these departures
have resulted in more refined products, a more
resourceful civilization, and a more sensitive
people.</p>

<p>Complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
 developments have been taken out
of and away from agriculture, and have left it
with the simple and undifferentiated products
and the elemental contact with nature. The
farmer is largely a residuary force in society;
this explains his conservatism.</p>

<p>If we have very highly developed persons
in the city, we have very rugged persons in the
country. If the sense of brotherhood is highly
evolved in the city, individualism is strongly
expressed in the country. If the world-movement
appeals to men in the city, local attachments
have great power with men in the
country. If commercial consolidation and organization
are characteristic of the city, the
economic separateness of the man or family is
highly marked in the country. The more
marked progress of the city is due to its greater
number of leaders and to its consolidated interests;
country people are personally as progressive
as city people of equal intellectual
groups, but they have not been able to attract
as much attention or perhaps to make as much
headway.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<a name="Comparisons_of_town_and_country_affairs"
id="Comparisons_of_town_and_country_affairs"></a>
<i>Comparisons of town and country affairs.</i></h3>

<p>Civilization oscillates between two poles.
At the one extreme is the so-called laboring
class, and at the other are the syndicated and
corporate and monopolized interests. Both
these elements or phases tend to go to extremes.
Many efforts are being made to weld
them into some sort of share-earning or commonness
of interest, but without very great
results. Between these two poles is the great
agricultural class, which is the natural balance-force
or the middle-wheel of society. These
people are steady, conservative, abiding by
the law, and are to a greater extent than we
recognize a controlling element in our social
structure.</p>

<p>The man on the farm has the opportunity
to found a dynasty. City properties may come
and go, rented houses may be removed, stocks
and bonds may rise and fall, but the land still
remains; and a man can remain on the land
and subsist with it so long as he knows how to
handle it properly. It is largely, therefore, a
question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
 of education as to how long any family
can establish itself on a piece of land.</p>

<p>In the accelerating mobility of our civilization
it is increasingly important that we have many
anchoring places; and these anchoring places
are the farms.</p>

<p>These two phases of society produce marked
results in ways of doing business. The great
centers invite combinations, and, because society
has not kept pace with guiding and correcting
measures, immense abuses have arisen and the
few have tended to fatten on the many. There
are two general modes of correcting, or at least
of modifying, these abuses,&mdash;by doing what we
can to make men personally honest and responsible,
and by evening up society so that all
men may have something like a natural opportunity.</p>


<h3><a name="The_two_minds" id="The_two_minds"></a><i>The two minds.</i></h3>

<p>There is a town mind and a country mind.
I do not pretend to know what may be the
psychological processes, but it is clear that the
mode of approach to the problem of life is
very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
 different as between the real urbanite and
the real ruralite. This factor is not sufficiently
taken into account by city men who would
remove to real farms and make a living there.
It is the cause of most of the failure of well-intentioned
social workers to accomplish much
for country people.</p>

<p>All this is singularly reflected in our literature,
and most of all, perhaps, in guide-books.
These books&mdash;made to meet the demand&mdash;illustrate
how completely the open country has
been in eclipse. There is little rural country
discoverable in these books, unless it is mere
"sights" or "places,"&mdash;nothing of the people,
of the lands, of the products, of the markets,
of the country dorfs, of the way of life; but
there is surfeit of cathedrals, of history of cities,
of seats of famous personages, of bridges and
streets, of galleries and works of art. We begin
to see evidences of travel out into the farming
regions, part of it, no doubt, merely a
desire for new experiences and diversion, and
we shall now look for guide-books that recognize
the background on which the cities rest.
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
 all this will call for a new intention in
travel.</p>


<h3><a name="Will_the_American_farmer_hold_his_own"
id="Will_the_American_farmer_hold_his_own"></a>
<i>Will the American farmer hold his own?</i></h3>

<p>What future lies before the American farmer?
Will he hold something like a position of independence
and individualism, or will he become
submerged in the social order, and form only
an underlying stratum? What ultimate hope
is there for a farmer as a member of society?</p>

<p>It is strange that the producer of the raw
material has thus far in the history of the world
taken a subordinate place to the trader in this
material and to the fabricator of it. The trader
and fabricator live in centers that we call cities.
One type of mind assembles; the other type
remains more or less scattered. So there have
arisen in human society two divergent streams,&mdash;the
collective and co√∂perative, and the isolated
and individualistic.</p>

<p>The fundamental weakness in our civilization
is the fact that the city and the country
represent antagonistic forces. Sympathetically,
they have been and are opposed. The city
lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
 on the country. It always tends to destroy
its province.</p>

<p>The city sits like a parasite, running out its
roots into the open country and draining it of
its substance. The city takes everything to
itself&mdash;materials, money, men&mdash;and gives
back only what it does not want; it does not
reconstruct or even maintain its contributory
country. Many country places are already
sucked dry.</p>

<p>The future state of the farmer, or real
countryman, will depend directly on the kind
of balance or relationship that exists between
urban and rural forces; and in the end, the
state of the city will rest on the same basis.
Whatever the city does for the country, it
does also for itself.</p>

<p>Mankind has not yet worked out this organic
relation of town and country. City and country
are gradually coming together fraternally,
but this is due more to acquaintanceship than
to any underlying co√∂peration between them
as equal forces in society. Until such an
organic relationship exists, civilization cannot
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
 perfected or sustained, however high it may
rise in its various parts.</p>


<h3><a name="The_first_two_remedies" id="The_first_two_remedies"></a>
<i>The first two remedies.</i></h3>

<p>Of course there are no two or even a dozen
means that can bring about this fundamental
adjustment, but the two most important means
are at hand and can be immediately put into
better operation.</p>

<p>The first necessity is to place broadly trained
persons in the open country, for all progress
depends on the ability and the outlook of men
and women.</p>

<p>The second necessity is that city folk and
country folk work together on all great public
questions. Look over the directories of big
undertakings, the memberships of commissions
and councils, the committees that lay plans for
great enterprises affecting all the people, and
note how few are the names that really represent
the ideas and affairs of the open country. Note
also how many are the names that represent
financial interests, as if such interests should
have the right of way and should exert the
largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
 influence in determining public policies.
In all enterprises and movements in which
social benefit is involved, the agricultural country
should be as much represented as the city.
There are men and women enough out in the
open country who are qualified to serve on such
commissions and directories; but even if there
were not, it would now be our duty to raise
them up by giving rural people a chance.
Rural talent has not had adequate opportunity
to express itself or to make its contribution to
the welfare of the world.</p>

<p>I know it is said, in reply to these remarks,
that many of the city persons on such organizations
are country-born, but this does not change
the point of my contention. Many country-born
townsmen are widely out of knowledge
of present rural conditions, even though their
sympathies are still countryward. It is also
said that many of them live in country villages,
small cities, and in suburbs; but even so, their
real relations may be with town rather than
country, and they may have little of the farm-country
mind; and the suburban mind is
really a town mind.</p>

<p>Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
 broad public movement should have
country people on its board of control. Both
urban and rural forces must shape our civilization.</p>


<h3><a name="Movement_from_city_to_country_as_a_remedy"
id="Movement_from_city_to_country_as_a_remedy"></a>
<i>Movement from city to country as a remedy.</i></h3>

<p>Some persons seem to think that the movement
of city men out to the country offers a
solution of country problems. It usually offers
only a solution of a city problem,&mdash;how a city
man may find the most enjoyment for his leisure
hours and his vacations. Much of the rising
interest in country life on the part of certain
people is only a demand for a new form of
entertainment. These people strike the high
places in the country, but they may contribute
little or nothing to real country welfare. This
form of entertainment will lose its novelty, as
the sea-shore loses it for the mountains and the
horse loses it for the motor-car or a√´roplane.
The farming of some city men is demoralizing
to real country interests. I do not look for
much permanent good to come to rural society
from the moving out of some of the types of
city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
 men or from the farming in which they
ordinarily engage.</p>

<p>I am glad of all movements to place persons
on the land who ought to go there, and to direct
country-minded immigrants away from the
cities; but we must not expect too much from
the process, and we must distinguish between
the benefit that may accrue to these persons
themselves and the need of reconstruction in
the open country. It is one thing for a family
to move to the land in order to raise its own
supplies and to secure the benefits of country
life; it is quite another thing to suppose that
an exodus from city to country will relieve the
economic situation or make any difference in
the general cost of living, even assuming
that the town folk would make good farmers.
And we must be very careful not to confuse
suburbanism and gardening with country
life.</p>

<p>To have any continuing effect on the course
of rural development, a person or an agency
must become a real part and parcel of the
country life.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<a name="Sending_the_surplus_population_to_the_country"
id="Sending_the_surplus_population_to_the_country"></a>
<i>Sending the surplus population to the country.</i></h3>

<p>It is also proposed to send to the country
the poor-to-do and the dissatisfied and the
unemployed. This is very doubtful policy.
In the first place, the presumption is that a
person who does not do well or is much dissatisfied
in the town would not do well in the
country. In the second place, the country does
not need him. We may need more farm
labor, as we need more of all kinds of labor,
but in the long run this labor should be produced
mostly in the country and kept there by
a profitable and attractive rural life. The city
should not be expected permanently to supply
it. The labor that the city can supply with
profit to country districts is the very labor that
is good enough for the city to keep.</p>

<p>The relief of cities, if relief is to be secured,
must lie in the evolution of the entire situation,
and not merely in sending the surplus population
into the country.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the present back-to-the-farm
cry is for the most part unscientific and unsound,
as a corrective of social ills. It rests
largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
 on the assumption that one solution of
city congestion is to send people away from
itself to the open country, and on another
assumption that "a little farm well tilled" will
abundantly support a family. There is bound
to be a strong reaction against much of the
present agitation. We are to consider the welfare
of the open country as well as that of the
city itself. The open country needs more good
farmers, whether they are country-bred or city-bred;
but it cannot utilize or assimilate to any
great extent the typical urban-minded man;
and the farm is not a refuge.</p>


<h3><a name="Back-to-the-village" id="Back-to-the-village"></a>
<i>Back-to-the-village.</i></h3>

<p>It seems to me that what is really needed is
a back-to-the-village movement. This should
be more than a mere suburban movement. The
suburban development enlarges the boundaries
of the city. It is perfectly feasible, however,
to establish manufacturing and other concentrated
enterprises in villages in many parts of
the country. Persons connected with these
enterprises could own small pieces of land,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
 by working these areas could add something
to their means of support, and also satisfy
their desire for a nature-connection. In many
of the villages there are vacant houses and
comparatively unoccupied land in sufficient
number and amount to house and establish
many enterprises; and there would be room
for growth. If the rural village, freed from
urban influences, could then become a real
integrating part of the open country surrounding
it, all parties ought to be better served
than now, and the social condition of both
cities and country ought to be improved. We
have over-built our cities at the expense of the
hamlets and the towns. I look for a great
development of the village and small community
in the next generation; but this involves
a re-study of freight rates.</p>


<h3><a name="Can_a_city_man_make_a_living_on_a_farm"
id="Can_a_city_man_make_a_living_on_a_farm"></a>
<i>Can a city man make a living on a farm?</i></h3>

<p>Yes, if he is industrious and knows how.
Many city persons have made good on the
land, but they are the exceptions, unless they
began young.</p>

<p>There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
 is the most curious confusion of ideas
on this question. We say that farming requires
the highest kind of knowledge and at the same
time think that any man may go on a farm, no
matter how unsuccessful he may have been
elsewhere. Even if he has been successful as
a middleman or manufacturer or merchant, it
does not at all follow that he would be successful
as a farmer. Farming cannot be done at
long range or by proxy any more than banking,
or storekeeping, or railroading, and especially
not by one who does not know how;
and he cannot learn it out of books and bulletins.
If a man can run a large factory without
first learning the business, or a theater or a
department store, then he might be able also
to run a farm, although the running of a farm
of equal investment would probably be the
more difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>I am glad to see earnest city men go into
farming when they are qualified to do so, but
I warn my friends that many good people who
go out from cities to farms with golden hopes
will be sadly disappointed. Farming is a good
business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
 and it is getting better, but it is a
business for farmers; and on the farmers as a
group must rest the immediate responsibility
of improving rural conditions in general.</p>

<p>The younger the man when he begins to
consider being a farmer, the greater will be his
chances of success; here the student has the
great advantage.</p>

<p>City people must be on their guard against
attractive land schemes. Now and then it is
possible to pay for the land and make a living
out of it at the same time, but these cases are
so few that the intending purchaser would
better not make his calculations on them. Farming
is no longer a poor man's business. It
requires capital to equip and run a farm as well
as to buy it, the same as in other business. It
is a common fault of land schemes to magnify
the income, and to minimize both the risks
and the amount of needed capital. Plans that
read well may be wholly unsound or even impossible
when translated into plain business
practice. The exploiting of exceptional results
in reporter's English and with charming pictures
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
 having a very dangerous effect on the
public mind; and even some of these results
may not stand business analysis.</p>


<h3><a name="What_the_city_may_do" id="What_the_city_may_do"></a>
<i>What the city may do.</i></h3>

<p>It is not incumbent on cities, corporations,
colleges, or other institutions to demonstrate,
by going into general practical farming, that
the farming business may be made to pay:
thousands of farmers are demonstrating this
every day.</p>

<p>If the city ever saves the open country, it will
be by working out a real economic and social
co√∂rdination between city and country, not by
the city going into farming.</p>

<p>We need to correct the abnormal urban
domination in political power, in control
of the agencies of trade, in discriminatory
practices, and in artificial stimulation, and
at the same time to protect the evolution
of a new rural welfare. The agrarian situation
in the world is not to be met
alone by increasing the technical efficiency of
farming.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DECLINE_IN_RURAL_POPULATION_ABANDONED" id="THE_DECLINE_IN_RURAL_POPULATION_ABANDONED"></a>THE DECLINE IN RURAL POPULATION&mdash;ABANDONED
FARMS</h2>


<p>The decline in rural population grows out
of economic conditions. Men move to the
centers, where they can make the best living
for themselves and families. It is difficult,
however, for the farmer to "pull up stakes"
and move. He is tied to his land. The result
is that many men who really could do
better in the town than on their farms are still
remaining on the land. These persons will
continue to remove to towns and cities as they
are gradually forced off their lands; or if they
are not forced off, their children will go, and
the farm will eventually change hands.</p>

<p>Social reasons also have their influence in
the movement of rural populations to towns.
The social resources in the country in recent
years have been very meager, because the social
attractions of the towns have drawn away from
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
 activities of the open country, and also
more or less because the population itself is
decreasing and does not allow, thereby, for so
close social cohesion.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that the counter-movement
from the towns and cities to the
open country will yet balance in numbers the
movement of population from the country to
the city.</p>

<p>It is important that conditions be so improved
for the open country that those who are
born on the farms and who are farm-minded
shall feel that opportunities are at least as good
for them there as in the city, and thereby prevent
the exodus to the city or to other business
of persons who really ought to remain in
the rural regions.</p>


<h3><a name="Significance_of_the_decline"
id="Significance_of_the_decline"></a><i>Significance of the decline.</i></h3>

<p>It is commonly assumed that a decline in
rural population in any region is itself evidence
of a real decline in agriculture. This conclusion,
however, does not at all follow. The
shift in population as between town and country
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
 an expression of very many causes. In
some cases it may mean a lessening in economic
efficiency in the region, and in some cases an
actual increase in such efficiency.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that we have been
passing from the rural to the urban phase of
civilization. The census of 1900 showed approximately
one-third of our people on farms or
closely connected with farms, as against something
like nine-tenths a hundred years previous.
It is doubtful whether we have yet struck
bottom, although the rural exodus may have
gone too far in some regions; and we may
not permanently strike bottom for some time
to come.</p>

<p>We think of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe,
and other early patriots as countrymen,
and we are likely to deplore the fact that countrymen
no longer represent us in high places.
The fact is that "the fathers" represented all
society, because society in their day was not
clearly differentiated between city and country.
They were at the same time countrymen and
city men, but the city was the incidental or
secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
 interest. To-day, the conditions are
reversed. The city has come to be the preponderating
force, and the country is largely
incidental and secondary so far as the shaping
of policies is concerned; but this does not prove
that a greater ratio of country population is
needed. The number of persons now living
in the open country is probably sufficient, if
the persons were all properly effective. The
real problem before the American people is
how to make the country population most
effective, not how to increase this population;
the increase will be governed by the operation
of economic law.</p>

<p>The sorting of our people has not yet reached
its limit of approximate stability. Many persons
who live on the land really are not farmers, but
are the remainders of the rural phase of society.</p>

<p>A decline in rural population in any region
may be expressive of the general adjustment as
between country and city; it may mean the
passing out of active cultivation of large areas
of land that ought to be in forest or in extensive
systems of agriculture; it may mean the
moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
 out of well-to-do farmers to cheaper
lands, as an expression of the land-hunger of
the American; it may be due in some cases to
the retiring of well-to-do persons from the farms
to the town; and other causes are at work in
particular localities. The rural population of
Iowa is decreasing, but the agricultural production
and land valuation are increasing.</p>

<p>The lessened production of live-stock, of
which we have recently heard so much, is probably
not due to any great extent, if at all, to
decreasing rural population. It is in part due
to the shift in farming following the passing of
the western ranges, and in part to the lack of a
free market, and in part to a changing adjustment
in farming practices. This situation will
take care of itself if the markets are not manipulated
or controlled.</p>

<p>Many publicists are alarmed at the lessened
production of farm products in comparison with
imports, and fear that the balance of trade will
be seriously turned against us, with a rise in
the rate of exchange. It is not to be expected
that we shall maintain our former rate of export
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
 raw crops, nor is it desirable from the point
of view of maintaining the fertility of our lands
that we should do so; but the maintenance of
production is now to depend on farming every
acre better, in larger farms as well as in smaller
farms, rather than on taking up new acres.</p>

<p>The ultimate importance of agriculture to
civilization, in other words, lies not in the number
of persons it supports, but in the fact that
it must continue to provide supplies for the
populations of the earth when mining and
exploitation are done, when there are no new
lands, and when we shall have taken away all
the first flush of the earth's bounty. The character
of the farm man, therefore, becomes of
supreme importance, and all the institutions of
society must lend themselves to this personal
problem.</p>

<p>We shall never again be a rural people. We
want the cities to grow; and as they grow they
should learn how to manage themselves. How
they shall meet their questions of population is
not my problem; and I have no suggestions to
make on that subject.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<a name="The_abandoned_farms" id="The_abandoned_farms"></a>
<i>The abandoned farms.</i>
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</h3>

<p>If persons move from any part of the country
until there is a marked absolute falling off
in population, it must follow that certain lands
shall be left unused, or shall be combined with
adjacent lands into larger business units. It is
no anomaly that there are "abandoned farms"
(they are seldom really abandoned, but more
or less unused), and it is natural that they
should be in the remoter, hillier, and poorer
regions. So are shop buildings abandoned on
back streets, and likewise factories on lonely
streams.</p>

<p>Some farms in the remote or difficult regions
are still well utilized, because a skillful man
has met the situation; others may be very
nearly or quite disused; between the two extremes
there is every shade of condition. Some
farms are falling into disuse for one reason and
some for another. In some cases, it is because
the family is merely broken up and is moving
off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
 In other cases, it is because the farm can
no longer make a good living for a man and
his family, giving him the things that a man of
the twentieth century wants. A farm in the
hill region that was large enough to support a
man fifty or seventy-five years ago, may not
support him at the present time with all his
increase in desires <a href="#Page_106">(page 106)</a>.</p>

<p>It is no solution of any question merely to
put other families back on disused farms. It
is worse than no solution to place there a more
ignorant family than was on the place originally;
and yet there is a movement all over the country
to place raw foreigners on such farms as
owners or renters. Because these farms are
cheap, they appeal to city people, and they become
temptations to real estate dealers. Bargain-counter
farms are rarely good investments.</p>

<p>What is to be done with these farms is, at
bottom, a plain economic question. If they
will not pay in ordinary farming, no one should
be forced to occupy them. They might be
well utilized, in many cases, for community or
county forestry purposes. Every county in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
 East that has many remote and difficult
hill lands could probably profit by a system of
public forestry, organized on a comprehensive
state plan.</p>

<p>I have said that farms are abandoned for all
kinds of reasons. It does not follow because a
family has given up a certain farm that the place
has ever been really tested on its merits; the man
may not have been a farmer at all, but only a
resident. Misfortune in the family, or the lack
of children, may be the reason for the desertion.
So it happens that some so-called abandoned
farms are first-class properties to purchase as
ordinary farms.</p>

<p>The best lands will naturally be the first to
be taken up by persons who know. And the
value of land for farming will depend very
much on its accessibility and nearness to market.
Even though it is possible to raise two
hundred and fifty bushels of potatoes on a distant
hilltop, it does not follow that it is profitable
to raise them there. Many persons who
are now living on difficult lands, would undoubtedly
be much better off if they were in
cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
 or towns; but as a rule, a man cannot
safely enter a new business after forty years of
age.</p>

<p>We must, of course, do the best we can to
help the man who actually lives on one of
these difficult farms, to enable him to make the
very most of his opportunities. This is being
done through many agencies. He has been
taught in methods of soil handling, fertilizing,
grass-growing, stock-raising, drainage, and many
other particular features. But it is also important
that we do not encourage others to enter
the same condition.</p>

<p>So I have no fear of the abandoned farm,
although I wish that we had a fundamental
treatment of the whole situation,&mdash;like state
programs,&mdash;so that lands in the process of
returning to nature may be managed in a large
and systematic way, that they might contribute
the best results to the community and
the country. We now know how to make
these lands productive, but there is a larger
question than this. Such lands&mdash;once farmed
and now going fallow&mdash;may be found from
California<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
 to Maine. In many cases they are
not being abandoned rapidly enough, and this
accounts for the human tragedy connected with
some of the old homesteads. But they will all
be used in good time, and we shall need them.</p>

<p>Little of the older country is worn out.
Some of the best land values now lie in the old
East and South. Movement to these lands
from the Western lands is now beginning, and
this is a sound tendency, as are most spontaneous
movements inside the farming business
itself; the railroads and real estate dealers may
be expected to even up the situation.</p>


<h3><a name="The_new_farming" id="The_new_farming"></a><i>The new farming.</i></h3>

<p>Although the ratio of farmers to the whole
population may still decrease, the actual number
of farmers will increase. The rural districts
will fill up. More young men and
women will remain on farms and more persons
will go from towns to farms as rapidly as the
business becomes as lucrative as other businesses
requiring equal investment, risks, and
intelligence. The open country will probably
fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
 up mostly with the natural increase of the
country population, and there will be some to
spare for the cities. We shall face the question
of congestion of farm districts.</p>

<p>The general growth of population will make
additional demands on the farm, not only because
there will be more persons to supply,
but also because desires increase with the increase
of wealth. It may require no more food
to sustain a well-to-do person than a poor-to-do
person, but as one increases his income
he greatly extends the range of his food and
improves its quality. Luxuries increase.</p>

<p>But beyond his actual food, one's desires
increase directly with his income; and, aside
from the minerals and metals, most of the
material that is used in the arts and manufactures,
in clothing, shelter, and adornment, is
raised from the land. The human-food products
do not comprise one-half the output of the
land.</p>

<p>We have covered in a way the "easy" farming
regions. But in the end, all the country
will be needed for productive uses; and the
best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
 civilization will come only when we conquer
the difficult places as well as utilize the
easy ones. We shall develop greater skill in
farming than we have yet dreamed of. The
raw and ragged open country that we see everywhere
from trolley-lines and railway-trains is
not at all a necessary condition; it is only a
phase of a transition period between the original
conquest of the country and the growing
utilization of our resources. The more completely
we conquer and utilize it, the more
resourceful and hopeful our people should be.
Country life will become more differentiated
and complex. Speaking broadly, we are now
in the rough and crude stage of our agricultural
development; but the situation will develop
only as it pays and satisfies persons to live in
the country.</p>

<p>To meet the economic, social, educational,
religious, and other needs of these great open
regions will require the very best efforts that
our people can put forth; and our institutions
are not now sufficiently developed to meet the
situation adequately.</p>

<h2><a name="RECLAMATION_IN_RELATION_TO" id="RECLAMATION_IN_RELATION_TO"></a>RECLAMATION IN RELATION TO
COUNTRY LIFE; AND THE RESERVE
LANDS</h2>


<p>All forms of reclamation, by which lands
are made available for agricultural use, profoundly
affect society and institutions; and
any person who is interested in rural civilization
must necessarily, therefore, be interested
in these means and their results. Because
reclamation by irrigation has progressed farther
than other means, and has become a national
policy, I shall confine my remarks to it
chiefly.</p>

<p>The best rural civilization will develop out
of native rural conditions rather than be
imposed from without. Irrigation makes a
rural condition: it provides the possibility
for a community to develop; and it must,
therefore, color the entire life of the community.</p>

<p>Irrigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
 communities are compact. As all
the people depend on a single utility, so must
the community life tend to be solidified and
tense. Probably no other rural communities
will be so unified and so intent on local
social problems. We shall look, therefore,
for a very distinct and definite welfare to
arise in these communities; and they will make
a peculiar contribution to rural civilization.</p>

<p>The life of the irrigation community will
be expressed not only in institutions of its
own, but in a literature of its own. Much
of the world's literature does not have significance
to country-life conditions, and very little
of it has significance to an irrigation civilization.
I look for poetry to come directly out of the
irrigation ditch and to express the outlook
of the people who depend for their existence
on the canal and the flood-gate.</p>


<h3><a name="The_interests_of_society_in_the_work"
id="The_interests_of_society_in_the_work"></a>
<i>The interests of society in the work.</i></h3>

<p>The people have made it possible for irrigation-reclamation
to be developed; for whether
the work is performed by government directly
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
 by private enterprise, it nevertheless rests
mostly on national legislation; and this legislation
expresses the consent and the interest
of society in the work. All the people have
not only a right to an interest in irrigation-reclamation,
but they carry an obligation to be
interested in it, since it reclaims and utilizes
the fundamental heritage of all the people.
I take it that society's interest in the work is
of two kinds: to see that the land is properly
utilized and protected; to see that persons
desiring homes shall have an opportunity to
secure them. Society is not interested in
speculation in land or in mere exploitation.</p>

<p>I hope that the irrigation people realize
their obligation to the society that makes it
possible for them to develop their irrigation
systems. Not every person in the nation
agrees to the policy of national reclamation,
but society has given it a trial. The people
in the West are interested in developing their
localities and their commonwealths, and in
securing settlers to them; and with this feeling
we all must sympathize. The people in the
East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
 have a remoter interest, but it is none
the less real. I have no fear that the irrigation-settlement
of the West will set up disastrous
competition in products with the East,
as many Eastern people anticipate; the areas
involved in the new irrigation projects are
too small and the development too slow for
that. But there is danger that the producing-power
of the land may not be safeguarded,
and all the people, East as well as West, must
have concern for use of Western land. The
very fact that irrigation-farming is intensive
increases the danger. From an agricultural
point of view, the greatest weakness in this
farming is the fact that the animal, or live-stock,
does not occupy a large place in the
system. Other systems of maintaining fertility
must be developed.</p>

<p>Society has a right to ask that we be careful
of our irrigated valleys. They are abounding
in riches. It is easy to harvest this wealth,
by the simple magic of water. We will be
tempted to waste these riches, and the time
will come quickly when we will be conscious
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
 their decline. This seems remote now, but
the danger is real. Not even the fertility
of the irrigation waters will maintain the land
in the face of poor agricultural practice.</p>

<p>I am not contending that irrigation-farming
is proceeding in a wasteful way, or that
systems are not developing that will protect
society; I am calling attention to the danger
and to the interest of all the people in this
danger; and I hope that we may profit by the
errors of all new settlements thus far made
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>It is the flat valleys of the great arid
West that will be opened by irrigation.
These valleys are small areas compared with
the uplands, the hills, and the unirrigable
regions. Society is interested also that we be
careful of the uplands and hills, for in the
arid regions they give small yield in forage
and in timber; this forage and timber must
be most thoughtfully protected. When the
producing-power of the irrigated lands begins
to decline, the West cannot fall back on its dry
hills.</p>

<p>We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
 are everywhere in need of better agriculture,
not only that every agriculturist may
do a better business, but also that agriculture
may contribute its full share to the making
of a better civilization. Here and there, as
we learn how to adapt ourselves to the order
of nature, we begin to see a really good agriculture
in the process of making. A good
agriculture is one that is self-sustaining and
self-perpetuating, not only increasing its yields
year after year from the same land, but
leaving the land better and richer at each
generation. This must come to pass from
the land itself and from the animals and crops
that one naturally brings to the land, and not
merely by the addition of mined fertilizing
materials brought from the ends of the earth.
Thus far in history, it is only when the virgin
fatness begins to be used up, speaking broadly,
that we put our wits to work. Then the
rebound comes. The best agriculture thus
far has developed only after we have struck
bottom, and we begin a constructive effort
rather than an exploitative effort; and this
comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
 in a mature country. This is why so
great part of the European agriculture is so
much better than our own, and why in old
New England such expert and hopeful farming
is now beginning to appear. The East is in
the epoch of rebound. The East is in the
process of becoming more fertile; the West
is in the process of becoming less fertile.</p>

<p>In Western North America, the business
systems have been developed to great perfection,
and the people are possessed of much
activity, and are so far escaped from tradition
that they are able to do things in new ways
and to work together. I hope that this great
region also will apply at the outset all the resources
of business and of science to develop
an agriculture that will propagate itself.</p>


<h3><a name="A_broad_reclamation_movement"
id="A_broad_reclamation_movement"></a><i>A broad reclamation movement.</i></h3>

<p>When all the lands are taken that can be
developed or reclaimed by private resources,
there remain vast areas that require the larger
powers, and perhaps even the larger funds, of
society (or the government) to bring into utilization.
One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
 class of lands can be utilized
by means of irrigation. This form of land-reclamation
is much in the public mind, and
great progress has been made in it.</p>

<p>There remain, however, other lands to be
reclaimed by other means. There is much
more land to be reclaimed by the removal of
water than by the addition of water. There
are many more acres to be adapted to productive
uses by forest planting and conservation
than by irrigation. There are vastly larger
areas waiting reclamation by the so-called
"dry-farming" (that is, by moisture-saving
farming completely adapted to dry regions).
And all the land in all the states must be
reclaimed by better farming. I am making
these statements in no disparagement of irrigation,
but in order to indicate the relation of
irrigation to what should be a recognized
national reclamation movement.</p>


<h3><a name="Supplemental_irrigation"
id="Supplemental_irrigation"></a><i>Supplemental irrigation.</i></h3>

<p>Let me say further that irrigation is properly
not a practice of arid countries alone.
Irrigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
 is for two purposes: to reclaim
land and make it usable; to mitigate the
drought in rainfall regions. As yet the popular
imagination runs only to reclamation-irrigation.
This form of irrigation is properly
regulated by the federal government.</p>

<p>Now and then a forehanded farmer in the
humid region, growing high-class crops, installs
an irrigation plant to carry him through
the dry spells. As our agriculture becomes
more developed, we shall greatly extend this
practice. We shall find that even in humid
countries we cannot afford to lose the rainfall
from hills and in floods, and we shall hold at
least some of it against the time of drought as
well as for cities and for power. We have not
yet learned how to irrigate in humid regions,
but we certainly shall apply water as well as
manures to supplement the usual agricultural
practices.</p>

<p>We must learn to reckon with drought as completely
as we reckon with winter or with lessening
productiveness. We probably lose far more
from dry spells than from all the bugs and pests.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<a name="We_need_reserves" id="We_need_reserves"></a><i>We need reserves.</i></h3>

<p>But even though we should recognize a
national reclamation movement to include all
these phases and others, it may not be necessary
or advisable in the interest of all the
people, that every last acre in the national
domain be opened for exploitation or settlement
in this decade or even in this century.
The nation may well have untouched reserves.
No one knows what our necessities will be a
hundred years hence. Land that has never
been despoiled will be immeasurably more
valuable to society then than now; and society
holds the larger interest.</p>

<p>When the pressure of population comes, we
shall fall back on our reserves. The rain-belt
states will fall back on their wet lands, their
uplands, and their hills. These hills are much
more usable than those of the arid and semi-arid
West can ever be. The Eastern and old
Southern states have immense reserves, even
though the titles may be largely in private
ownership. New York is still nearly half in
woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
 and swamps and waste, but practically
all of it is usable. New York is an undeveloped
country, agriculturally. The same is
true of New England and Pennsylvania and
great regions southwards. Forests and sward
grow profusely to the summits of the mountains
and hills. Vast areas eastward are undeveloped
and unexploited. Even the regions
of the so-called "abandoned farms" are yet
practically untouched of their potential wealth.</p>

<p>I have no regret that these countries are still
unsettled. There is no need of haste. When
the great arid West has brought every one of
its available acres into irrigation, and when
population increases, the Eastern quarter of the
country will take up the slack. It is by no
means inconceivable that at that time the Eastern
lands, newly awakened from the sleep of
a century, will be the fresh lands, and the
older regions will again become the new.</p>

<p>We should be careful not to repeat, even on
a small scale, the recklessness and haste with
which we have disposed of our reserves before
their time.</p>

<h2><a name="WHAT_IS_TO_BE_THE_OUTCOME" id="WHAT_IS_TO_BE_THE_OUTCOME"></a>WHAT IS TO BE THE OUTCOME
OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION?</h2>


<p>We know that the whole basis of civilization
is changing. Industry of every kind is taking
the place of the older order. Its most significant
note is that it brings the people of the
world together in consultation and in trade.
We are escaping our localism, and we look on
all problems in their relation to all mankind.
Brotherhood has become a real power in the
world.</p>

<p>But what does industry in itself, including all
forms of land-culture, offer as an ultimate goal
to civilized man? What are to be the man's
ideals toward which he should lead his
thoughts?</p>

<p>I am not one of those who consider a sordid
and commercial end to be the necessary result of
industrialism. We must develop the ideals in
an industrial civilization, that they may lead us
into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
 the highest personal endeavor; and everywhere
it should be possible for a man to make
the most of himself. There must be something
in every business beyond the financial gain if it
is to make any final contribution to civilization.
Finding this ultimate, industrial society will
grow into perfect flower.</p>

<p>So far as agriculture is concerned, I see two
points of high endeavor within the business,
lying beyond the making of a good living, and
toward which the coming countryman may set
his imagination.</p>


<h3><a name="The_making_of_a_new_society"
id="The_making_of_a_new_society"></a>(1) <i>The making of a new society.</i></h3>

<p>A new social order must be evolved in the
open country, and every farmer of the new time
must lend a strong hand to produce it. We
have been training our youth merely to be
better farmers; this, of course, is the first thing
to do, but the man is only half trained when
this is done. What to do with the school, the
church, the rural organizations, the combinations
of trade, the highways, the architecture,
the library, the beauty of the landscape, the
country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
 store, the rousing of a fine community
helpfulness to take the place of the old selfish
individualism, and a hundred other activities, is
enough to fire the imagination and to strengthen
the arm of any young man or woman.</p>

<p>The farmer is to contribute his share to the
evolution of an industrial democracy.</p>


<h3><a name="The_fighting_edge" id="The_fighting_edge"></a>(2) <i>The fighting edge.</i></h3>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt, with his power to discern
essentials, has given us a good rallying
phrase in "the fighting edge." When man
ceases to be a conqueror, he will lose his virility
and begin to retrograde. As localism gives way
to brotherhood, militarism will pass out; but
this does not mean that mankind will cease
to contend.</p>

<p>The best example I have seen of the development
of determination and fine social brotherhood
is in the making of the Panama Canal.
The making of the Canal is in every sense a
conquest. It is a new civilization that the
40,000 or 50,000 folk are constructing down
there, and every man, whether he is employed
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
 the commissariat, the sanitary department,
in an office, on a steam shovel, or with a construction
gang, will tell you that he is building
the Canal. All these people are giving a good
account of themselves because they are doing
the work under the flag and because they are
contending with vast difficulties.</p>

<p>We have scarcely begun even the physical
conquest of the earth. It is not yet all explored.
The earth is an island, and it is only
two years ago that we got to one end of it.
There are mountains to pierce, sea-shores to reclaim,
vast stretches of submerged land to drain,
millions of acres to irrigate and many more
millions to utilize by dry-farming, rivers to
canalize, the whole open country to organize
and subdue by means of local engineering work,
and a thousand other great pieces of construction
to accomplish, all calling for the finest
spirit of conquest and all contributing to the
training of men and women. There is no
necessity that the race become flabby.</p>

<p>Now, my point is that the prime high endeavor
laid before every farmer is to conquer
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
 farm, and this means contest with storm
and flood and frost, with blight and bug and
pest, and with all the other barriers that nature
has put against the man that tills the land.
We have made a tremendous mistake, in my
estimation, in trying to portray farming merely
as an easy business. The sulky-plow has been
too much emphasized. We are giving the
young men more means and tools by which
to wage the contest, but the contest can never
stop. In the nature of things, farming cannot
be an easy and simple business, and this is why
it has produced a virile lot of men and women,
and why it will continue to do so. It is a
question whether, if our civilization is ever
evened up, we shall not look again to the open
country for strong working classes, for the
course of much of our city industrialism is to
make dependent men and managed men, and
we need to exercise every precaution that it
does not make clock-watchers and irresponsible
gang-servers <a href="#Page_139">(page 139)</a>.</p>

<p>Farming will attract folk with the feeling of
mastery in them, even more in the future than
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
 the past, because the hopelessness, blind resignation,
and fatalism will be taken out of it.
Those who are not masterful cannot conquer a
farm. The man weighing one hundred and
fifty pounds who is afraid of a San Jos√© bug
would better go to the city, where he can find
some one to help him fight his battles. The
farmer will learn how to adapt his scheme to
nature, and how to conquer the things that are
conquerable; and this should make it worth
his while to be a farmer.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FUNDAMENTAL_QUESTION" id="THE_FUNDAMENTAL_QUESTION"></a>THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION
IN AMERICAN COUNTRY LIFE</h2>


<p>How to make country life what it is capable
of becoming is the question before us; and
while we know that the means is not single or
simple, we ought to be able to pick out the
first and most fundamental thing that needs
now to be done.</p>

<p>It is perfectly apparent that the fundamental
need is to place effectively educated men and
women into the open country. All else depends
on this. No formal means can be of
any permanent avail until men and women of
vision and with trained minds are at hand to
work out the plans in an orderly way.</p>

<p>And yet it is frequently said that the first
necessity is to provide more income for the
farmer; but this is the result of a process, not
the beginning of it. And again it is said that
organization is the first necessity, even to make
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
 possible to use the education. If organization
is necessary to make the best use of education,
then it assumes education as its basis.
Educated men will make organization possible
and effective, but economic organization will
not insure education except remotely, as it becomes
a means of consolidating an unorganic
society.</p>

<p>But there is no longer any need to emphasize
the value of education. It would now be
difficult to find an American farmer who requires
convincing on this point. Yet I have
desired to say that there is no other agency,
using education in its broad sense, that can by
any possibility be placed ahead of it.</p>


<h3><a name="Agriculture_in_the_public_schools" id="Agriculture_in_the_public_schools"></a><i>Agriculture in the public schools.</i></h3>

<p>Agriculture is now a school subject. It is
recognized to be such by state syllabi, in the
minds of the people, and in the minds of most
school men. It is finding its way into high-schools
and other schools here and there.</p>

<p>There is no longer much need to propagate
the idea that agriculture is a school subject.
It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
 is now our part to define the subject,
organize it, and actually to place it in the
schools.</p>

<p>We must understand that the introduction
of agriculture into the schools is not a concession
to farming or to farmers. It is a school
subject by right.</p>

<p>It is the obligation of a school to do more than
merely to train the minds of its students. The
school cannot escape its social responsibilities;
it carries these obligations from the very fact
that it is a school supported by public money.</p>

<p>The schools, if they are to be really effective,
must represent the civilization of their
time and place. This does not mean that every
school is to introduce all the subjects that engage
men's attention, or that are capable of being
put into educational form; it means that it
must express the main activities, progress, and
outlook of its people. Agriculture is not a
technical profession or merely an industry, but
a civilization. It is concerned not only with
the production of materials, but with the distribution
and selling of them, and with the
making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
 of homes directly on the land that produces
the material. There cannot be effective
homes without the development of a social
structure.</p>

<p>Agriculture therefore becomes naturally a
part of a public-school system when the system
meets its obligation. It is introduced into
the schools for the good of the schools themselves.
It needs no apology and no justification;
but it may need explanation in order
that the people may understand the situation.</p>

<p>If agriculture represents a civilization, then
the home-making phase of country life is as
important as the field farming phase <a href="#Page_93">(page 93)</a>.
As is the home, so is the farm; and as is the
farm, so is the home. Some of the subjects
that are usually included under the current
name of home economics, therefore, are
by right as much a part of school work as any
other subjects; they will be a part of city
schools as much as of country schools if the
city schools meet their obligations. They are
not to be introduced merely as concessions to
women or only as a means of satisfying popular
demand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
 they are not to be tolerated: they
are essential to a public-school program.</p>


<h3><a name="The_American_contribution" id="The_American_contribution"></a><i>The American contribution.</i></h3>

<p>The American college-of-agriculture phase of
education is now well established. It is the
most highly developed agricultural education
in the world. It is founded on the democratic
principle that the man who actually tills the
soil must be reached,&mdash;an idea that may not
obtain in other countries.</p>

<p>We are now attempting to extend this democratic
education by means of agriculture to all
ages of our people, and there is promise that
we shall go farther in this process than any
people has yet gone; and this fact, together
with the absence of a peasantry, with the right
of personal land-holding, and with a voice in
the affairs of government, should give to the
people of the United States the best country
life that has yet been produced.</p>

<p>America's contribution to the country-life
situation is a new purpose and method in education,
which is larger and freer than anything
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
 has yet been developed elsewhere, and
which it is difficult for the Old World fully to
comprehend.</p>

<p>The founding of the great line of public-maintained
colleges and experiment stations
means the application of science to the reconstruction
of a society; and it is probably destined
to be the most extensive and important
application of the scientific method to social
problems that is now anywhere under way.</p>


<h3><a name="The_dangers_in_the_situation" id="The_dangers_in_the_situation"></a><i>The dangers in the situation.</i></h3>

<p>It is not to extol our education experiment
that I am making this discussion, but to measure
the situation; and I think that there are
perils ahead of us, which we should now recognize.</p>

<p>There are two grave dangers in the organization
of the present situation: (1) the danger that
we shall not develop a harmonious plan, and
thereby shall introduce competition rather than
co√∂peration between agencies; (2) the danger
that the newer agencies will not profit fully by
our long experience in agriculture-teaching.</p>

<p>An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
 internal danger is the giving of instruction
in colleges of agriculture that is not
founded on good preparation of the student or
is not organized on a sound educational basis.
Winter-course and special students may be
admitted, and extension work must be done;
but the first responsibility of a college of agriculture
is to give a good educational course:
it deals with education rather than with agriculture,
and its success in the end will depend
on the reputation it makes with school men.</p>

<p>There is also danger that new institutions
will begin their extension work in advance of
their academic educational work; whereas, extension
and propaganda can really succeed only
when there is a good background of real accomplishment
at home.</p>

<p>There is necessity that we now reorganize
much of our peripatetic teaching. It is no
longer sufficient to call persons together and
exhort them and talk to them. We have come
about to the end of agricultural propaganda.
All field and itinerant effort should have a
follow-up system with the purpose to set every
man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
 to work on his own place with problems
that will test him. We have been testing soils
and crops and fertilizers and live-stock and
machines: it is now time to test the man.</p>

<p>There is also danger that we consolidate too
many rural schools in towns. If it is true that
the best country life is developed when persons
live actually on their farms, then we should be
cautious of all movements that tend to centralize
their interests too far from home, and particularly
to centralize them in a town or in a
village. The good things should come to the
farm rather than that the farm should be obliged
to go to the good things.</p>


<h3><a name="The_present_educational_institutions" id="The_present_educational_institutions"></a><i>The present educational institutions.</i></h3>

<p>We must first understand what our institutions
of education are. The extension of
agriculture-education in institutions in the
United States (beyond the regular colleges of
agriculture) is in four lines: as a part of the
regular public-school work; in unattached
schools of agriculture publicly maintained; in
departments attached to other colleges or universities;
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
 private schools. The last category
(the private schools) may be eliminated from
the present discussion.</p>

<p>The separate or special-school method is
well worked out in Wisconsin (county plan), in
Alabama and Georgia (congressional-district
plan), Minnesota (regional plan), with other
adaptations in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Michigan,
Maryland, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In New York, the movement for special
schools has taken an entirely new direction.
Two schools are connected with existing institutions
of higher learning of long-established
reputation (being the only schools of this kind,
state-maintained, attached to liberal arts universities)
and one is unattached; none of them
has a defined region or territory. These institutions
are established on a more liberal financial
plan than the special schools of other states,
standing somewhat between those schools and
the agricultural college type.</p>

<p>While much publicity has been given to the
unattached-school plan, the main movement is
the adding of agriculture-education to the
existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
 public-school systems. Only eight or
ten of the states have entered into any regular
development of separate or unattached schools,
whereas in every state the movement for agriculture
in the public schools is well under way.
The public schools are of definite plan; the
unattached schools are of several plans, or of
no plan; and in some states an intermediate
course is developing by the establishing of
public high-schools (one to a county, a congressional
district, or other region) in which
instruction in agriculture and household subjects
is highly perfected.</p>

<p>Aside from the foregoing particular institutions,
many general colleges and universities are
introducing agricultural work in order to meet
the increasing demand and to keep up with
educational progress.</p>

<p>Agricultural work is proceeding in nearly all
the states under the auspices of the United States
Department of Agriculture, some of it distinctly
educational in character; and there is agitation
for the passage of a national bill to further secondary
or special agriculture-education in the
states.</p>

<p>State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
 departments of agriculture, the indispensable
experiment stations, veterinary colleges,
departments of public instruction, farmers' institutes,
voluntary societies, are all attacking the
country-life problem in their own ways; and the
powerful work of the agricultural press, although
not coming within the scope of this paper, should
not be overlooked as an educational agency.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the colleges of agriculture
are growing rapidly and are approaching the
subject from every side, and are assuming
natural and inevitable leadership.</p>


<h3><a name="The_need_of_plans_to_coordinate_this_educational_work" id="The_need_of_plans_to_coordinate_this_educational_work"></a><i>The need of plans to co√∂rdinate this educational
work.</i></h3>

<p>There is no doubt that all these agencies are
contributing greatly to the solution of the rural
problem, and there is now probably very little
inharmony and little duplication of effort. In
the newness and enthusiasm of the effort, good
fellowship holds the work together in all the
states or at least keeps it from collision. But
the situation is inherently weak, because there
is no plan or system, and no united discussion
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
 the grounds on which the work rests. I have
been in correspondence on this question with
public men in every state in the Union, and I
find a general feeling that the present situation
is fraught with danger, and that there is great
need of organization or at least of federation
of the forces within each state; and ultimately
there must be federation on a national basis.
The work should be co√∂perative rather than
competitive.</p>

<p>What is to be the policy of the state in agriculture-education?
Where is the headship to lie?
What are to be the spheres of the different institutions
and agencies? What board or agency
is to correlate and unify all the parts, to insure
a progressive and well-proportioned program?</p>


<h3><a name="Outline_of_a_state_plan" id="Outline_of_a_state_plan"></a><i>Outline of a state plan.</i></h3>

<p>A general law should define the state's policy
in education by means of agriculture and in
the development of rural affairs, and outline
methods that it proposes to follow, so that the
work may be co√∂rdinated throughout the state
and that a definite plan may be projected.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
 duties of all the classes of institutions
should be defined and relations should be
established between them. The people should
know to what they are committing themselves.</p>

<p>This law should not, of course, be designed
to suppress the activities of any institution. It
might not place any institution under the domination
of any other institution. The schools,
colleges, and other institutions for the betterment
of agriculture should have their own
autonomy and responsibility, and they should
be developed to the highest point of efficiency
in their respective spheres.</p>

<p>The fundamental consideration in such a
law should be to develop the agriculture and
advance the country life of the state by organizing
the work of all the agencies on a systematic
plan, so that an orderly development may be
secured. Such a recognized general policy
should do much to insure each institution in
the system its proper state support.</p>

<p>It is probably too much to expect that a
fundamental state law could be projected abstractly.
Laws are gradually built up to meet
urgent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
 needs as they arise; but if the principles
are kept in mind, the making of separate and
special laws might be so guided as to produce
a harmonious result.</p>

<p>Some of the particular points that I think
should be desired in such a law or series of laws
are these:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. It should propound a policy in the development
of country life;</p>

<p>2. It should name the classes of institutions
that it proposes to utilize in the execution
of this policy;</p>

<p>3. It should define the functions of the
different classes of institutions;</p>

<p>4. It should state the organic relationships
that ought to exist between them all;</p>

<p>5. It might provide an advisory council to
guide agricultural education and advancement
in the state. I think that
the directors or responsible heads of
such institutions established for the
betterment of agriculture throughout
the state should constitute such consulting
body, to which questions of
policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
 and procedure should be referred
and which, of course, should
serve without remuneration. This
council might include also the commissioner
of agriculture and the superintendent
of public instruction. It
might be well to have one, two, or
three other persons appointed by the
governor. The council would constitute
a natural conference of the parties
that are immediately responsible for
this work, without taking the management
of any institution out of the
hands of an existing board. The idea
of such a body is to further the co√∂rdination
by conference, rather than to
have plenary power. Its moral influence
ought to be all the greater because
of its lack of conferred power.</p></blockquote>


<h3><a name="A_state_extension_program" id="A_state_extension_program"></a><i>A state extension program.</i></h3>

<p>As soon as a state has produced strong
institutions for research and education in agriculture,
it will need to provide an agency for
utilizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
 the results. A state extension program,
on a co√∂rdinating plan between all the institutions
but proceeding from one educational
center, and which all the institutions would
have a right to use for the spread of their work
among the people, could accomplish vast
benefits. It should comprise institutes, utilize
the state system of fairs educationally, afford an
organ for the making of agricultural surveys
and demonstrations, spread an educational propaganda
on the agricultural law, collect and collate
the experience of the farmers of the state. It
could assort and apply the information that the
state, at great expense, accumulates through its
various separate agencies. It could utilize the
students, whom the state provides with free
tuition. The germ of such an enterprise already
exists in most of the states.</p>


<h3><a name="Special_local_schools_for_agriculture" id="Special_local_schools_for_agriculture"></a><i>Special local schools for agriculture.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</h3>

<p>I am committed to the idea that there should
be strong local centers of interest in rural communities,
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
 thereby we develop local pride
and incentive. There are several ways, on the
educational side, of developing local institutions
and interest.</p>

<p>The first way is to make it possible and
practicable for the existing public schools to
introduce agriculture and domestic economy.
I suggest that many or most localities would
do better to develop the country-life work in
the existing schools than to ask the legislature
for a separate special school. We have only
begun to understand what such redirected and
expanded schools may accomplish.</p>

<p>Another means of securing local knowledge
and developing local interest is by the establishing
of demonstration farms and field-laboratories.
It is doubtful whether a permanent
demonstration farm in a community is desirable;
in general, the demonstration may be
temporary, depending on the presence in the
community of some special difficulty. In some
circumstances, the enterprise may amount to
a local testing station. Enterprises of this sort
are bound to take on great importance in the
redirection of country life.</p>

<p>Local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
 societies and organizations may be encouraged
to take up educational and experiment
work.</p>

<p>Departments of agriculture will probably be
added by colleges or other educational institutions,
and these will serve as local centers at
the same time that they reach the larger field.</p>

<p>Again, a winter school or short-course of,
say, a month's or two months' duration may
be held in different parts of the state. The
localities should co√∂perate in the expenses,
thereby becoming partakers in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Eventually there should be an agricultural
agent resident in every county, and perhaps
even for smaller regions, whose office should
be to give advice, to keep track of animal and
plant diseases and pests and secure the services
of experts in their control, to organize conferences,
winter-courses, and the like, and otherwise
to be to the agricultural affairs what the
pastor is to religious affairs and the teacher to
educational affairs. (See "The Training of
Farmers," p. 257.)</p>

<p>Finally, we may ask the state to place a
special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
 school of agriculture in the locality, but
only after it is clear that other means cannot
produce the desired results. An unattached
school of agriculture is not an easy thing to
administer successfully, even at the best; and
the difficulty would be all the greater if its care
were to be confined to local boards, which would
probably have small understanding of the peculiar
educational requirements. It is probable
that a state may wisely establish a very few
special schools, but an educational program
needs first to be worked out, a competent system
of control must be found, and the people
should know in advance what is involved.
It is not enough merely that a locality desires
a school: the larger question is the state's interest.
In all local enterprises of this kind in
which state aid is asked for, it ought to be
understood that the locality itself is to co√∂perate
in the securing of equipment and funds.</p>


<h3><a name="The_lessons_of_experience" id="The_lessons_of_experience"></a><i>The lessons of experience.</i></h3>

<p>The demand for agriculture-education is
now widespread; the subject is becoming
"popular."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
 All kinds of plans are being
tried or discussed.</p>

<p>Persons do not seem to realize that we have
had about one hundred years of experience in
the United States in agriculture-education, and
that this experience ought to point the way to
success, or at least to the avoiding of serious
errors. The agricultural colleges have come
up through a long and difficult route, and their
present success is not accidental, nor is it easy
to duplicate or imitate. First and last, about
every conceivable plan has been tried by them,
or by others in their time or preceding them;
and this experience ought to be utilized by the
other institutions that are now being projected
in all parts of the country.</p>

<p>Plans that certainly cannot succeed are now
being projected. The projectors seem to proceed
on the idea that it requires no background
of experience to enable an institution to teach
agriculture, whereas agriculture-education is the
most difficult and also the most expensive of
all education yet undertaken.</p>

<p>To teach agriculture merely by giving a new
direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
 or vocabulary to botany, chemistry,
geology, physics, and the like is not to teach
agriculture at all, although it may greatly improve
these subjects themselves. To put a
school of agriculture in the hands of some good
science-teacher in a general college faculty with
the idea that he can cover the agricultural
work and at the same time keep up his own
department, is wholly ineffective (except temporarily)
and out of character with the demands
of the twentieth century (but in high-schools
a good science teacher may handle the work,
or an agriculture teacher may carry the science).
To suppose that "agriculture" is one subject
for a college course, to be sufficiently represented
by a "chair," is to miss the point of
modern progress. To give only laboratory
and recitation courses may be better than
nothing, but land-teaching, either as a part
of the institution or on adjacent farms, must
be incorporated with the customary school work
if the best results are to be secured. To make
a school farm pay for itself and for the school is
impossible unless the school is a very poor or
exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
 small one; and yet this old fallacy
is alive at the present day. To have a distant
farm to visit and look at, in order to "apply" the
"teachings" of chemistry, botany, and the like,
falls far short of real agriculture instruction.
To develop a "model farm" that shall be a
pattern to the multitude in exact farming is
an exploded notion: there are many farmers'
farms that are better adapted to such purpose
(the demonstration farm is the modern adaptation
of the idea, and it is educationally
sound).</p>

<p>To teach agriculture of college grade requires
not only persons who know the subject, but an
organization well informed on the educational
administration that is required. There must
be a body of experience in this line of work
behind any teaching on a college plane that
shall be really useful; when this body of experience
does not exist, the work must necessarily
grow slowly and be under the most
expert direction. The presumption is still
against successful agriculture work in the literary
and liberal arts institutions, because such
teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
 demands a point of view on education
that the men in these institutions are likely
not to possess. Agriculture cannot be introduced
in the same way that a department or
chair of history or mathematics can be organized;
it requires a different outlook on
educational procedure, a different order of
equipment and of activities, and its own type
of administration.</p>

<p>I am much afraid that some of the newer
unattached institutions, in their eagerness to
make departures and to be self-sufficient, will
not profit by our long development, and
that the secondary schools and others may
make many of the mistakes that the regular
colleges of agriculture long ago have made.
The presumption is against any school that
expects to develop merely a local enterprise,
without reference to other schools or to experience.</p>

<p>I am sure we all want to encourage the
introduction of agriculture into all educational
institutions, but we should not be misled
merely by the word "agriculture"; and in the
interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
 of good work we should be careful
not to encourage any enterprise of this kind
until convinced that it has been well studied
and that it will be administered in the interest
of rural progress.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="WOMANS_CONTRIBUTION_TO_THE" id="WOMANS_CONTRIBUTION_TO_THE"></a>WOMAN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE
COUNTRY-LIFE MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>On the women depend to a greater degree
than we realize the nature and extent of the
movement for a better country life, wholly
aside from their personal influence as members
of families. Farming is a co-partnership
business. It is a partnership between a man
and a woman. There is no other great series
of occupations in which such co-partnership
is so essential to success. The home is on
the farm, and a part of it. The number of
middle-aged unmarried men living on farms
is very small. It is quite impossible to live
on a farm and to run it advantageously without
family relation.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that if the farming business
is to contribute to the redirection of country
life, the woman has responsibilities as well as
the man. As the strength of a chain is determined
by its weakest link, so will the progress
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
 rural civilization be determined by the weakness
of the farm as an economic unit, or by
the weakness of the home as a domestic and
social unit.</p>

<p>Now, the farmer himself cannot have great
influence in redirecting the affairs of his community
until he is first master of his own
problem,&mdash;that is, until he is a first-class
farmer. In the same way, a woman cannot
expect to have much influence in furthering
the affairs of her rural community until she
also is master of her own problem, and her
problem is primarily the home-making part of
the farm. In the mastering of his or her
own problem, the farmer or his wife may also
contribute directly to the progress of the
community. Every advance in the management
of the household contributes to the general
welfare: it sets new ideas under way.</p>

<p>If the farming business must in general be
reorganized, so also must the householding
part of it be reorganized. The solution of the
farm-labor problem, for example, lies not alone
merely in securing more farm "hands," but in
so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
 directing and shaping the business that less
farm hands will be needed to secure a given
economic result; so also the solution of the
household-labor problem is not merely the
securing of more household help, but the simplification
of householding itself.</p>

<p>So far as possible, the labor that is necessary
to do the work of the open country,
whether in-doors or out-doors, should be resident
labor. The labor difficulty increases with
reduction in the size of the family. Families
of moderate size develop responsibility, and
co√∂peration is forced on all members of it,
with marked effect on character. The single
child is likely to develop selfishness rather
than co√∂peration and sense of responsibility.
To a large extent, the responsibility of the
household should rest on the girls of the
family; and all children, whether boys or girls,
should be brought up in the home in habits
of industry.</p>

<p>It is fairly possible by means of simplification
of householding and by a co√∂perative
industry amongst all members of the family,
so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
 to reduce the burden of the farm wife that
she may have time and strength to give to the
vital affairs of the community.</p>


<h3><a name="The_affairs_of_the_household" id="The_affairs_of_the_household"></a><i>The affairs of the household.</i></h3>

<p>It is essential that we simplify our ideals in
cooking, in ornament, in apparel, and in furnishing;
that we construct more convenient
and workable residences; that we employ
labor-saving devices for the house as well as
for the barns and the fields.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to the ordinary
modes of living that we scarcely realize what
amount of time and strength might be saved
by a simplified table and by more thoughtful
methods of preparing food. In respect to
houses, it should be remembered that the present
farm dwellings are getting old. A good
part of the farm houses must soon be either
rebuilt or remodeled. The first consideration
is so to build or remodel them that steps may
be saved to the housewife. We have not
thought, in the past, that a woman's steps cost
time and energy. Within twenty years all
first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
 farm houses will have running water,
both into the house and out of the house.</p>

<p>It is rather strange that in our discussions
of the farm-labor problem, we do not realize
that a gasoline engine or a water engine may
save the labor of a man. Farmers are putting
power into their barns. They should also put
power into the house. This may be accomplished
by means of a small movable engine
that can be used either in the house or barn,
or else by installing an engine in a small building
betwixt the house and the barn, so that it
can be connected either way. This can be
used to lighten much household labor, as
pumping of water, meat-chopping, laundering,
dish-washing, vacuum-cleaning, and the like.</p>

<p>Eventually, there must be some form of
community co√∂peration in the country to save
household labor. Already the care of milk
has been taken from great numbers of farm
homes by the neighborhood creamery, or at least
by the building of a milk-house in which the
men by the use of machinery perform labor
that was once done by the housewife. Whenever
there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
 is a co√∂perative creamery, there
may also be other co√∂perative attachments, as
a laundry, or other appliances. It will be
more difficult to bring about co√∂peration in
these regards in country districts than in the
city, but with the coming of good roads, telephones,
and better vehicles, it will be constantly
more easy to accomplish.</p>


<h3><a name="The_affairs_of_the_community" id="The_affairs_of_the_community"></a><i>The affairs of the community.</i></h3>

<p>I have said that it is important that the
country woman have strength and time to engage
in the vital affairs of the community.
I am thinking of the public sentiment that
women can make on any question that they
care to discuss thoroughly and collectively,
whether this sentiment is for better orcharding,
better fowls, better roads, extending of telephones,
improving the schoolhouse or church
or library. It is needful that women in the
country come together to discuss woman's
work, and also to form intelligent opinions on
farming questions in general.</p>

<p>The tendency of all "sociables" in country
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
 town is to bring persons together to eat,
to gossip, and to be entertained. We need to
redirect all these meetings, and to devote at
least a part of every such meeting to some real
and serious work which it is worth while for
busy and intelligent persons to undertake.</p>

<p>Every organization of women should endeavor
to extend its branches and its influence
into the open country as well as into the cities
and towns. Every public movement now has
responsibility to country-life questions as well
as to town questions.</p>

<p>I think it important that there be some
means and reason for every farm woman going
away from home at least once a week, and this
wholly aside from going to town to trade.
There should be some place where the women
may come together on a different basis from
that of the ordinary daily routine and the usual
buying and selling. I do not know where this
social center should develop, and in an atmosphere
that is not conducive to gossip. In some
neighborhoods it might focalize in the church
parlor. The center should be permanent, if
possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
 It should be a place to which any
woman in a community has a right to go. An
ideal place for such a center would be the rural
library, and I hope that such libraries may arise
in every country community, not only that they
may supply books but that they may help provide
a meeting-place on semi-social lines. I
think that if I were a woman in charge of a
rural library, I should never be satisfied with my
work until I had got every woman in the community
in the habit of coming to the library
once every week.</p>


<h3><a name="The_womans_outlook" id="The_womans_outlook"></a><i>The woman's outlook.</i></h3>

<p>The woman needs very much to have the
opportunity to broaden her horizon. The
farmer has lived on his farm; he is now acquiring
a world outlook. The woman has
lived in her house; she also is acquiring a
world outlook. As the house has been smaller
and more confining than the farm, it has followed
that woman's outlook has been smaller
than man's.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary also that the woman
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
 the farm, as well as the man, have a real
anchor in her nature environment. It is as
necessary to the woman as to the man that her
mind be open to the facts, phenomena, and
objects that are everywhere about her, as the
winds and weather, the plants and birds, the
fields and streams and woods. It is one of
the best resources in life to be able to distinguish
the songs and voices of the common
fields, and it should be a part of the education of
every person, and particularly of every country
person, to have this respite. The making of
a garden is much more than the growing of the
radishes and strawberries and petunias. It is
the experience in the out-of-doors, the contact
with realities, the personal joy of seeing things
germinate and grow and reproduce their kind.</p>


<h3><a name="The_means_of_education" id="The_means_of_education"></a><i>The means of education.</i></h3>

<p>If country women are to develop a conscious
sense of responsibility in country-life betterment,
education facilities must be afforded
them. The schools must recognize home-making
subjects equally with other subjects.
What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
 becomes a part of the school eventually
becomes a part of the life of the people
of the region.</p>

<p>The leadership in such subjects is now being
taken by the colleges of agriculture. This is
not because domestic subjects belong in a college
of agriculture more than elsewhere, but
only that these colleges see the problem, and
most general colleges or universities have not
seen it. The college of agriculture, if it is
highly developed, represents a civilization
rather than a series of subjects; and it cannot
omit the home-making phase if it meets its
obligation to the society that it represents
<a href="#Page_64">(page 64)</a>.</p>

<p>If the customary subjects in a college of
agriculture are organized and designed to train
a man for efficiency in country life and to develop
his outlook, so also is a department of
home economics to train a woman for efficiency
and to develop her outlook to life.</p>

<p>Home economics is not one "department"
or subject, in the sense in which dairying or
entomology or plant-breeding is a department.
It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
 is not a single specialty. It stands for the
whole round of woman's work and place. Many
technical or educational departments will grow
out of it as time goes on. That is, it will be
broken up into its integral parts, and it will
then cease to be an administrative department
of an educational institution; and very likely
we shall lose the terms "home economics,"
"household economics," "domestic science,"
and the rest.</p>

<p>I would not limit the entrance of women
into any courses in a college of agriculture; on
the contrary, I want all courses open to them
freely and on equal terms with men; but the
subjects that are arranged under the general
head of home economics are her special field
and sphere. On the other hand, I do not
want to limit the attendance of men in courses
of home economics; in fact, I think it will be
found that an increasing number of men desire
to take these subjects as the work develops,
and this will be best for society in general.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I do not conceive it to be
essential that all teachers in home economic
subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
 shall be women; nor, on the other
hand, do I think it is essential that all teachers
in the other series of departments shall be men.
The person who is best qualified to teach the
subject should be the one who teaches it,
whether man or woman.</p>

<p>As rapidly as colleges and universities come
to represent society and to develop in all
students a philosophy of life, the home-making
units will of necessity take their place with
other units.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="HOW_SHALL_WE_SECURE_COMMUNITY" id="HOW_SHALL_WE_SECURE_COMMUNITY"></a>HOW SHALL WE SECURE COMMUNITY
LIFE IN THE OPEN
COUNTRY?</h2>


<p>It is generally agreed that one of the greatest
insufficiencies in country life is its lack of organization
or cohesion, both in a social and
economic way. Country people are separated
both because of the distances between their
properties, and also because they own their
land and are largely confined to its sphere of
activities. There is a general absence of such
common feeling as would cause them to act
together unitedly and quickly on questions that
concern the whole community, or on matters
of public moment.</p>

<p>This lack of united action cannot be overcome
by any single or brief process, but as
one result of a general redirection of rural effort
and the stimulating of a new or different point
of view toward life. It will come as a result
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
 a quickened agricultural life rather than as an
effect of any direct plan or propaganda. When
the rural social sense is thoroughly established,
we shall be in a new epoch of rural civilization.</p>

<p>It is now the habit to say that this desired
rural life must be co√∂perative. A society that
is fully co√∂perative in all ways is one from
which the present basis of competition is eliminated.
I think that no one intends, however,
in the common discussion of co√∂peration to
take sides on the theoretical question as to
whether society in the end will be co√∂perative
or competitive; these persons only mean that
co√∂perative association is often the best means
to secure a given result and that such association
may exert great educational influence on the
co√∂perators.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the co√∂perative organization
of society may be the better. Practically, a capitalistic
organization may be better: it quickly
recognizes merit and leadership; but if it is
better, it is so only when it is very carefully
safeguarded.</p>

<p>It cannot be contended that a co√∂perative
organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
 is correct because the majority
rules. Majorities show only what the people
want, not necessarily what is best. Minorities
are much more likely to be right, because thinking
men and fundamental students are relatively
few; yet it may be the best practice, in common
affairs, to let the majority have its way, for this
provides the best means of education.</p>

<p>It will now be interesting to try to picture to
ourselves some of the particular means by which
social connection in the open country may be
brought about. It is commonly, but I think
erroneously, thought that community life necessarily
means a living together in centers or
villages. I conceive, on the contrary, that it is
possible to develop a very effective community
mind whilst the persons still remain on their
farms. In this day of rapid communication,
transportation, and spread of intelligence, the
necessity of mere physical contiguity has partly
passed away.</p>

<p>That is, "isolation," as the city man conceives
of it, is not necessarily a bar to community
feeling. The farmer does not think in terms of
compact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
 neighborhoods, trolley cars, and picture
shows. The country is not "lonely" to him,
as it is to a city man. He does not search for
amusement at night.</p>


<h3><a name="Hamlet_life" id="Hamlet_life"></a><i>Hamlet life.</i></h3>

<p>It is said that the American farmer must live
in hamlets, as does the European peasant. The
hamlet system that exists in parts of Europe
represents the result of an historical condition.
It is the product of a long line of social evolution,
during which time the persons who have
worked the land have been peasants, and to a
greater or less extent have not owned the land
that they have worked.</p>

<p>Some persons fear that the American farmer is
drifting toward peasantry. This notion has no
doubt arisen from the fact that in certain places
the man who works the land is driven to great
extremity of poverty, and he remains uneducated
and undeveloped; but ignorance and
poverty do not constitute peasantry. The
peasanthood of the Old World is a social caste
or class, and is in part a remnant of feudal
government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
 of religious subjugation, and of
the old necessity of protection. The present
day is characterized by the rise of the people
on the land; this movement is a part of the
general rise of the common people (or the proletariat).
If popular education, popular rights,
and the general extension of means of communication
signify anything, it is that we necessarily
are developing away from a condition
of peasantry rather than toward it, however
much degradation or unsuccess there may be
in certain regions or how much inadjustment
there may be in the process <a href="#Page_129">(page 129)</a>.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the exclusive hamlet
system of living together, I would emphasize
the necessity that a first-rate good man must
live on the farm if he is to make the most of
it. Farming by proxy or by any absentee
method is just as inefficient and as disastrous
in the long run as the doing of any other
business by proxy; in fact, it is likely to be
even more disastrous in the end because it
usually results in the depletion of the fertility
of the land, or in the using up of the capital
stock;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
 and this becomes a national disaster.
I hold that it is essential that the very best
kind of people live actually on the land. The
business is conducted on the land. The crops
are there. The live-stock is there. The machinery
is there. All the investment is in the
place itself. If this business is to be most
effective, a good man must constantly be with
it and manage it. A farm is not like a store or a
factory, that is shut up at night and on Sunday.</p>

<p>The more difficult and complex the farming
business becomes, the greater will be the necessity
that a good man remain with it.</p>

<p>We must remember also that if the landowner
or the farmer lives in a village or hamlet
and another man lives on his farm, a social
division at once results, and we have a stratification
into two classes of society; and this works
directly against any community of interest. It
is not likely that the farmer who has retired to
town and the hired man who works his farm
under orders will develop any very close personal
relation. The farmer becomes an extraneous
element injected into the town, and
has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
 little interest in its welfare, and he has
taken his personality, enterprise, and influence
out of the country. He is in a very real
sense "a man without a country." The increase
of his living expenses in town is likely
to cause him to raise the rent on his farm, or,
if the tenant works for wages, to reduce the
improvements on the place to the lowest extent
compatible with profit. We need above all
things to produce such a rural condition as
will satisfy the farmer to live permanently in
the country rather than to move to town when
the farm has given him a competence.</p>

<p>I am not to be understood as saying that
farmers ought never to live in town. There
will always be shifting both ways between town
and country. In some cases, small-area farming
develops around a village; or a village grows
up because the farms are small and are intensively
handled. In irrigation regions, the whole
community may be practically a hamlet or village.
In parts of the Eastern states, small
farmers sometimes live in the village and go
to the farm each day, to work it themselves.
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
 all these are special adaptations, and do
not constitute a broad agricultural system.</p>

<p>In time we probably shall develop a new
kind of rural settlement, one that will be the
result of co√∂perative units or organizations, and
not a consolidation about the present kinds of
business places; but it is a question whether
these will be villages or hamlets in the sense in
which we now use these words.</p>


<h3><a name="The_category_of_agencies" id="The_category_of_agencies"></a><i>The category of agencies.</i></h3>

<p>My position, therefore, is that we must
evolve our social rural community directly from
the land itself, and mostly by means of the resident
forces that now are there.</p>

<p>This being our proposition, it is then necessary
to discover whether, given permanent residence
on pieces of land, it is still possible to
develop anything like a community sense. I
do not now propose to discuss this question
at any length, but merely to call attention to a
few ways in which I think the neighborhood
life of the open country may be very distinctly
improved.</p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
 this discussion, I purposely omit reference
to public utilities and governmental action, because
they are outside my present range. The
farmer will share with all the people any needful
improvement that may be made in regulation
of transportation and transportation rates,
in control of corporations, in equalizing of taxation,
in providing new means of credit, in extending
means of communication, in revising
tariffs, in reforming the currency, and in perfecting
the mail service.</p>

<p>To work out the means of neighborhood
co√∂peration, there should be sufficient and
attractive meeting places. The rural schoolhouse
is seldom adapted to this purpose. The
Grange hall does not represent all the people.
The church is not a public institution. Libraries
are yet insufficient. Town halls are few, and
usually as unattractive as possible. There is
now considerable discussion of community
halls. Several of them have been built in
different parts of the country to meet the new
needs, and the practice should grow.</p>

<p>1. The mere <a name="increase_of_population" id="increase_of_population"></a><i>increase of population</i> will nec
essarily
bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
 people closer together, and by
that much it will tend to social solidarity.</p>

<p>2. The natural <a name="dividing_up_of_large_farms" id="dividing_up_of_large_farms"></a><i>dividing up of large farms</i>,
which is coming both as a result of the extension
of population and from the failure of certain
very large estates to be profitable, will also
bring country people closer together. The so-called
"bonanza farms" are unwieldy and ineffective
economic units; and many farmers are
"land poor."</p>

<p>3. We shall also <a name="assemble_farms" id="assemble_farms"></a><i>assemble farms</i>. The increasing
population on the land will not always
result in smaller farms. Most of the richer
and more profitable lands will gradually be
divided because, with our increased knowledge
and skill, persons can make a living from
smaller areas. The remoter and less productive
lands will naturally be combined into
larger farm areas, however, because a large
proportion of such lands cannot make a sufficient
profit, when divided into ordinary farm
areas, to support and educate a present-day
family <a href="#Page_38">(page 38)</a>. Contiguous areas of the
better lands will be combined with them, in
order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
 to make a good business unit. As several
farms come together under one general ownership,
this owner will naturally gather about
him a considerable population to work his
lands.</p>

<p>The probability is that, under thoroughly
skillful single management, a given area of
remote or low-productive lands will sustain a
larger population than they are now able to
sustain under the many indifferent or incompetent
ownerships. It is to be hoped that
some of these amalgamated areas will develop
a share-working or associative farming of a
kind that is now practically unknown.</p>

<p>4. The <a name="re-creative_life" id="re-creative_life"></a><i>re-creative life</i> of the country community
greatly needs to be stimulated. Not
only games and recreation days need to be
encouraged, but the spirit of release from continuous
and deadening toil must be encouraged.
The country population needs to be livened up.
This will come about through the extension of
education and the work of ministers, teachers,
and organizations. All persons can come together
on a recreation basis (pp. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>, <a href="#Page_211">211</a>).</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
 good farmer will have one day a week
for recreation, vacation, and study.</p>

<p>5. <a name="Local_politics" id="Local_politics"></a><i>Local politics</i> ought to further the entire
neighborhood life, rather than to divide the
community into hostile camps. All movements,
as direct nominations, that stimulate
local initiative and develop the sense of responsibility
in the people will help toward this end.</p>

<p>6. <a name="Rural_government" id="Rural_government"></a><i>Rural government</i> is commonly ineffective.
It needs awakening by men and women who
have arrived at some degree of mastery over
their conditions. We talk much of the need
of improving municipal government, but very
little about rural government; yet government
in rural communities is inert and dead, as compared
with what it might be, and there is
probably as much machine politics in it, in
proportion to the opportunities, as in city government.
Very much of the lack of gumption
in the open country is due to the want of a
perfectly free and able administration of the
public affairs.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
 whole political organization of rural
communities needs new attention, and perhaps
radical overhauling. As I write these sentences,
I have before me a newspaper in which
a progressive surgeon expresses his opinion
(which he has verified for me) on the question
of supervision of health in a rural county in an
Eastern state. He found the statistics too
inaccurate and too indefinite to enable him to
draw exact conclusions, but these are approximately
the facts:</p>

<p>"No township seems to have deliberately
paid its health officer, and but one town deliberately
paid its poor physician. The others
paid various bills for 'quarantine' and 'fumigating'
and 'fees' and other misleading items.
There was no way in which to distinguish between
the care of the poor and the sick-poor
except to guess and to figure on what I happened
to know about. A&mdash;&mdash;, the richest and
largest township, has no health officers, and
spent $200 for the poor in a population of
4000 people living in an area of 93 square
miles. B&mdash;&mdash;, the poorest township, with a
population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
 of 1000, and an area of 36 square
miles, paid her health officer $28 and her poor
physician $23.</p>

<p>"One township has 2170 inhabitants living
in 51 square miles of territory, worth one and
one-eighth million dollars. Its supervisor is
paid $352.95 a year for a few days' work; its
officers are paid $612.95. It costs $274.79
each year to elect these officers, and I understand
each township is to spend about $5000
for good roads. The health officer that cares
for these 2000 people over 51 miles of territory
gets $42.53 a year, and the poor physician
$34; while the sick-poor get helped to
the munificent sum of $59.36, or two and one-half
cents from each citizen. The health officers
get almost exactly two cents a head for
caring for the inhabitants over 51 square miles
of land. The supervisor gets out of each inhabitant
seventeen cents a year, the officers get
thirty cents, while the sick-poor take from each
citizen almost three cents. The discrepancy is
too glaring to need comment. A community
assessed a million dollars and probably worth
two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
 millions spends $40 a year on public
health, and $60 a year on one-sixteenth of its
population for sickness."</p>

<p>The physician proposes a county commission
to take the place of the board of supervisors.
He declares that the members of the
board have outgrown their usefulness. "They
should be junked along with other stagecoaches
and a nice, new 60 h. p. county commission
put in their place. The fact is that
the system is wrong. Our 'government' is a
survival of early times, and our science is up to
date. They do not fit. You cannot expect
supervisors who were useful in the time of
Adam, when there were no cities, no problems,
no roads, to serve in the twentieth century
with its surgical treatment of degenerates, its
germs and prophylactics, its preventive medicine
and its scientific spirit. Supervisors could
look after noxious plants and animals in the old
days, and they could paper the court-house
and eat fat dinners at the poor-house. They
did fairly well at settling line fences, drinking
sweet cider, and blarneying with insurgents.
But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
 they are out of place when it is a question
of constructing roads of macadam, of building
a tuberculosis hospital for an $18,000,000
county, and especially they are out of place
when it is a question of dozens of defectives in
the jails and thousands outside who ought to
be in hospitals."</p>

<p>7. A <a name="community_program_for_health" id="community_program_for_health"></a><i>community program for health</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is much
needed. The farmer lives by himself in his own
house, on his own place. If a disease arises
in his neighbor's family, it is not likely to
spread to his family. Therefore, disease has
seemed to him to be a personal rather than a
neighborhood matter. There is the greatest
need that the farmer possess a community sense
in respect to disease and sanitary conditions.
If the city is the center of enlightenment, it
should help the country to get hold of this
problem.</p>

<p>We should have a thoroughgoing system of
health supervision and inspection for the open
country as well as in the city. Health inspection
should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
 run out from the cities and
towns into all the adjoining regions, maintaining
proper connections with state departments
of health. It should be continuous. It should
include inspection of animals as well as of
human beings. In other words, the whole
region is a unit, one part depending on the
other. The remarks of the physician, just
quoted, indicate how great is the need of an
organized health supervision for country communities.</p>

<p>We need meat inspection laws for meat
killed and sold within the states, to supplement
the inter-state law. We need community
slaughter-houses in which all slaughtering of
animals shall be under proper inspection.
We need state milk inspection programs. It
is not right that any large city should be compelled
to inspect the milk throughout the
state in order to protect itself. It is not right
to the farming districts that such inspection
should center in the city.</p>

<p>We must not assume that the farmer is
specially guilty of sanitary faults. There are
many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
 such shortcomings in the open country,
and I accept them without apology; but I can
match them every one in city conditions. The
fact is that the whole people has not yet risen
to an appreciation of thoroughly sanitary conditions,
and we cannot say that this deficiency
is the special mark of any one class of our population.
Persons ride along the country roads
and see repulsive barn-yards, glaring manure
piles, untidy back-yards, and at once make remarks
about them. All these things are relegated
to the rear in towns and cities and are
not so visible, but they exist there.</p>

<p>I know that there are very filthy stables in
the country districts, but I have never known
worse stable conditions than I have seen in
cities and towns. All progress in these directions
must come slowly, and we must remember
that it is expensive to rebuild and reorganize
a stable. No doubt one of the reasons for the
high cost of living is the demand of the people
that pure-food laws shall be enacted and enforced,
for this all adds to the cost of food supplies;
similarly, we must expect a betterment
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
 conditions of stabling to result in increased
price of dairy products. In the cost of living
we must figure the expense of having clean and
pure food.</p>

<p>The farmer is much criticized for polluting
streams; but when the farmer pollutes one
stream occasionally, a city will pollute a whole
system of streams continually. One of the
greatest sins of society is the wholesale befoulment
of streams, lakes, and water-courses. I do
not see how we can expect to be called a civilized
people until we have taken care of our
refuse without using it to fill up ponds and
lakes, and to corrupt the free water supplies of
the earth.</p>

<p>If the countryman has been ignorant of sanitary
conditions, we must remember that his
ideas are largely such as he has derived from
teachers, physicians, and others.</p>

<p>We cannot expect a man to develop within
himself enough community pride and altruism
to compel him to go to great expense for the
benefit of the public; but he will gladly contribute
his part to a public program.</p>

<p>8.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
 <a name="Local_factories_and_industries" id="Local_factories_and_industries"></a><i>Local factories and industries</i> of whatever
kind tend to develop community pride and
effectiveness. Creameries have had a marked
effect in this way in many places, giving the
community or locality a reason for existence
and a pride in itself that it never had before,
or at least that it had not enjoyed since the
passing out of the small factories. There is
much need of local industries in the open
country, whether they are distinctly agricultural
or otherwise, not only for the purpose of providing
additional employment for country
people but to direct the flow of capital and enterprise
into the country and to stimulate local
interest of all kinds. It is not by any means
essential that all the new life in country neighborhoods
should be primarily agricultural.</p>

<p>Much has been said of late about the necessity
of introducing the handicrafts in the open
country in winter with the idea of providing
work for farm people during that season. I
do not look for any great extension of this idea
in real agricultural sections, and for the following
reasons: (1) because as better agriculture
develops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
 the farms will of themselves employ
their help more continuously. Modern diversified
and intensive farming brings about
this result. The present-day dairying employs
men continuously. The fruit-grower needs
help in winter for pruning and spraying. Live-stock
men need help in feeding and caring for
the animals. Modern floriculture and vegetable-gardening
are likely to run the year round.
(2) The conditions of American country life
are such that skilled handicraft has not arisen
amongst the rural people, and we cannot expect
that it will arise. Skilled artisanship of this
kind is not the growth of a generation, nor is
it a result of the utilization of merely a few
weeks or months of time. (3) It is very
doubtful whether such handicrafts as are often
mentioned could compete in the markets with
the goods produced by consolidated factories,
or could find a sufficient patronage of people
interested in this kind of handicraft products.</p>

<p>I am not arguing against the introduction of
handicrafts, but wish only to call attention to
what I think to be an error in some of the current
discussions.
 I am convinced that local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
industries of one kind or another will find their
way into the open country in the next generation,
and greatly to the advantage of the country
itself; but the most useful of them will be
regular factories able to compete with other
factories. Their largest results will come not
in providing employment for persons who
temporarily need it, but in developing a new
community life in the places where they stand.</p>

<p>9. <a name="The_country_store" id="The_country_store"></a><i>The country store</i> ought to be a factor in
rural betterment. How to make it so, I do
not know. The country store is the nexus
between the manufacturers or the city jobbers,
with their "agreements," on the one hand, and
the people, on the other hand, whose commercial
independence the jobbers may desire to
control. The country merchant takes up the
cause of the large dealer, because his own welfare
is involved, and he unconsciously becomes
one of the agencies through which the open
country is drained and restrained. The parcels
post&mdash;which must come&mdash;will probably considerably
modify this establishment, although
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
 do not look for its abolition nor desire it.
Certain interests make strong opposition to the
parcels post on the ground that it will ruin the
country merchant and, therefore, the country
town. I doubt if it will do any such thing; but
even if it should, the end to be gained is not
that the country merchant shall not be disturbed,
but that the people at large may be benefited.
No one knows just what form of readjustment
the parcels post will bring about; but trade will
very soon readjust itself to this condition as it
has reacted to the introduction of farm machinery,
good roads, the telegraph and telephone,
rural free delivery.</p>

<p>The trader in the small town in some parts
of the country is likely to own the people.
He is almost necessarily opposed to co√∂peration
and to any new movements that do not
tend to enlarge his trade.</p>

<p>I wish we might also do something with the
country hotel.</p>

<p>10. <a name="The_business_mens_organizations" id="The_business_mens_organizations"></a><i>The business men's organizations</i>, or
chambers of commerce, in villages and country
cities will not confine their activities within the
city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
 boundaries in the future. A wholly new
field for usefulness and for the making of personal
reputation lies right here. The business
organization of one village or city should extend
out into the country until it meets a similar
organization from the adjoining village, and
the whole region should be commercially developed
<a href="#Page_122">(pages 122-123)</a>. A chamber of commerce
could exert much influence toward
making a better reputation for the pack of
apples, or for other output of the region.</p>

<p>11. The influence of certain <a name="great_corporations" id="great_corporations"></a><i>great corporations</i>
is likely to be felt on the rural readjustment.
This is particularly true of the new interest
that railroads are taking in Eastern agriculture.
A co√∂rdination between railroads and farming
interests will do very much for the property
of both sides; and the railroads can exercise
great power in tying country communities together.
The Wall Street Journal comments
as follows on the situation, after calling attention
to the fact that the "Eastern trunk lines
have already entered upon a campaign for the
encouragement of agriculture":</p>

<p>"Thirty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
 years ago the Pennsylvania state
legislature made an effort to save the farmers
of that state from the damaging competition of
ruinously low rates on Western grain to Eastern
mills and to the seaboard. The result was practically
nil. Eastern farmers were left so completely
out in the cold that thousands of them
sold out and went West to raise more grain there,
still further to handicap the Eastern producer.
The widespread bankruptcy of the middle states
farmers during the eighties was a consequence
partly of cut-throat competition among railroads
to haul Western grain to the East at less than
cost, and partly the result of a general depression
from which it took ten full years to recover.</p>

<p>"What is it that has brought the railroads
to the farmers on terms of co√∂peration for the
development of their common territory? It
is the same thing which has served the railroads
so admirably in the solution of their cost
problems. It is science applied to reducing
the expenses of transportation in the one case,
and to the greater mastery of the resources of
the soil in the other case. In this lies the
possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
 of increasing railway freight to and
from rural sources. The co√∂peration of transportation
and agriculture, in the East especially,
is not wholly new, but it is highly significant.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more encouraging than
the service which the railroads are beginning
to render in the better distribution of population
over the land, by putting a premium on
good farming and encouraging the young to
find careers for themselves in rural industries."</p>

<p>12. <a name="Local_institutions" id="Local_institutions"></a><i>Local institutions</i> of all kinds must have
a powerful effect in evolving a good community
sense. This is true in a superlative degree of
the school, the church, the fair, and the rural
library. These institutions will bring into the
community the best thought of the world and
will use it in the development of the people in
the locality.</p>

<p>Such institutions must do an extension work.
The church, from the nature of its organization,
could readily extend itself beyond its
regular and essential gospel work. The high-school
will hold winter-courses and will take
itself out to its constituency. The library ought
to occupy its whole territory <a href="#Page_92">(page 92)</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
 village improvement societies
should organize country and town together,
extending tree-care, better roads, lawn improvement,
and other good work throughout the
entire community contributory to the city.
Civic societies, fraternal orders, hospital associations,
business organizations <a href="#Page_119">(page 119)</a>,
women's clubs and federations, could do the
same.</p>

<p>13. <a name="The_local_rural_press" id="The_local_rural_press"></a><i>The local rural press</i> ought to have a
powerful influence in furthering community
action. Many small rural newspapers are
meeting their local needs, and are to be considered
among the agents that make for an improved
country life. In proportion as the
support of the country newspaper is provided
by political organizations, hack politicians, and
patent medicine advertisements, will its power as
a public organ remain small and undeveloped.</p>

<p>14. The influence of the <a name="many_kinds_of_extension_teaching" id="many_kinds_of_extension_teaching"></a><i>many kinds of extension
teaching</i> is bound to be marked. Reading-courses,
itinerant lectures, the organizing of
boys' and girls' clubs, demonstration farms,
the inspections of dairies, orchards, and other
farms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
 and of irrigation supplies, the organization
of such educational societies as cow-testing
societies, and the like, touch the very core of
the rural problem. The influence of the traveling
teacher is already beginning to be felt, and
it will increase greatly in the immediate future.
I mean by the traveling teacher the person
who goes out from the agricultural college, the
experiment station, the state or national department
of agriculture, or other similar institutions,
to impart agricultural information, and to set
the people right toward their own problems.</p>

<p>15. The modern extension of <a name="all_kinds_of_communication" id="all_kinds_of_communication"></a><i>all kinds of
communication</i> will unite the people, even though
it does not result in making them move their
residences. I have in mind good highways,
telephones, rural free deliveries, and the like.
The automobile is already beginning to have
its effect in certain rural communities, but we
have yet scarcely begun to develop the type of
auto-vehicle which is destined, I think, to make
a very great change in country affairs. The
improvement of highways on a regular plan
will itself tend to organize the rural districts.
We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
 must add to all this a thoroughly developed
system of parcels post, not only that the
farmer may receive mail, but that he may also
have greater facilities and freedom to transact
his business with the world <a href="#Page_118">(page 118)</a>.</p>

<p>16. <a name="Economic_or_business_cooperation" id="Economic_or_business_cooperation"></a><i>Economic or business co√∂peration</i> must be
extended. There is much co√∂peration of this
kind among American farmers, more than most
persons are aware. Some of it is very effective,
but much of it is co√∂perative only in name.
It takes the form of milk organizations, creameries,
fruit associations, poultry societies,
farmers' grain elevators, unions for buying
and selling, and the like, some of which are
of great extent.</p>

<p>A really co√∂perating association is one in
which all members take active part in government
and control, and share in their just
proportions in the results. It is properly a
society, rather than a company. Many so-called
co√∂perative units are really stock companies,
in which a few persons control, and the remainder
become patrons; and others are mere shareholding
organizations.</p>

<p>Business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
 co√∂peration in agriculture is of three
kinds: (1) co√∂perative production; (2) co√∂perative
buying; (3) co√∂perative selling. The
last two are extensively practiced in many
regions. Co√∂perative production of animals
and crops is practically unknown in the rural
communities in the United States, and we are
not to expect it to arise in those communities
to any extent under the present organization
of society. Colonies organized on a co√∂perative
basis may practice it within their membership,
but it is doubtful whether persons who
are well equipped to be farmers will enter such
organizations for this purpose so long as it is
so easy to make a financial success at independent
farming.</p>

<p>There is a fourth form that should be mentioned,
although it is not co√∂peration in the
real sense, but rather a form of combination.
I refer to movements to control the production
or output of commodities, as of wheat, cotton,
tobacco, maize, and arbitrarily to fix the price.
This cannot be permanently accomplished with
any of the great staples, and even if it could
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
 accomplished, in my opinion it would be an
economic and social error.</p>

<p>Very much has been said about the necessity
of business co√∂peration among farmers, and the
importance of the subject can hardly be overstated;
and yet it should be understood that
economic co√∂peration is only one of many means
that may be put in operation to propel country
life. The essential thing is that country life be
organized: if the organization is co√∂perative,
the results&mdash;at least theoretically&mdash;should be
the best; but in one place, the most needed
co√∂peration may be social, in another place
educational, in another religious, in another
political, in another sanitary, in another economic
in respect to buying and selling and
making loans or providing insurance. When
the chief deficiency in any region is economic,
then it should be met by an organization that is
primarily economic. Some of the effective co√∂peration
in the West, so often cited, is really
founded on the land-selling spirit of the community.</p>

<p>In some parts of the United States, the
financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
 status of the farmer is very low, but
in general the economic condition is in advance
of other conditions. The American farmer is
prosperous,&mdash;not as prosperous as he ought
to be, but so prosperous that he can conduct
his own business without support or aid of his
neighbors. Although he might gain financially
by co√∂peration in any case, he nevertheless
desires his complete freedom of action,
even at the risk of some loss. The psychology
of the American farmer is in the end the
determining factor.</p>

<p>In other countries, this may not be so true,
and particularly not when the farmers live
under such a condition of peasanthood (or
do not comprise a middle class) that no one
of them in a community is able independently
to buy his tools or his live-stock, or to secure
sufficient funds to provide a small working
capital, when both sales and purchases are
very small, and when the entire community is
practically subjugated by a political system.
The big people are more likely to combine
than to co√∂perate. Close co√∂peration naturally
works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
 best in a peasantry and under a
paternal government; it becomes a means of
bringing up the peasantry, of relieving them of
oppression, and of giving them the rights that
should be theirs as a part of their citizenship.</p>

<p>In Denmark, the co√∂perative movement has
been one means of the salvation of the country,
following the disastrous German war. The
movement in some parts of the world is really
a culture movement, having for a background
the general good of society.</p>

<p>The American white farmer is not a peasant;
he is not submerged in a hopeless political and
economic slavery; he has his vote, his free
school, his fee to hold property without let
or hindrance, his full right to make the most
of himself, his "rights" (<a href="#Page_100">pages 100</a> and <a href="#Page_65">65</a>).
I think it will be possible for him to exercise
these privileges and at the same time to share
the benefits of co√∂peration; but co√∂peration is
not necessary to win him these privileges. It
is not the unit in his life, not the nucleus out
of which all other agencies must evolve, or the
leaven that will raise the lump: it is itself
one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
 co√∂rdinating part in a program of evolution.
We do not have the problem of peasant
proprietorship. For the most part, the American
farmer has already won his economic
independence, if not his just rewards.</p>

<p>We should not be impatient if our farmers do
not organize themselves co√∂peratively as rapidly
as we think they ought to organize.</p>

<p>Economic personal co√∂peration may be expected
to thrive best in a community of small
farmers. It is a question whether we shall develop
the strongest leaders in a condition of
more or less uniform small farms. There is
much to be said in favor of rather large farming
(say 500 to 1000 acres), for a business of this
proportion demands a strong man. This does
not mean landlordism, which is a part of a
political and hereditary system, but merely large
and competent business organization. Such
farmers, if they are so minded, can accomplish
great things for their fellows.</p>

<p>I am looking for some of the best results in
co√∂peration to come from the establishment of
field-laboratories and demonstration farms, to
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
 the farmers of the locality contribute
their personal funds in the expectation of an
educational result. The best results to country
life cannot possibly come by the government
continuing to take everything to the farmer
free of cost and without the asking. Disadvantaged
or undeveloped regions must be
aided freely, but as rapidly as any localities or
industries get on their feet, they should meet
the state part way, and should assume their
natural share of the expense and responsibility.
This form of co√∂peration is already well under
way; and I suspect that in many localities
that have been dead to all forms of co√∂perative
effort, this idea will afford the starting-point
for a new community life.</p>

<p>From this form of education-co√∂peration, it
would be but a step to a neighborhood effort
to introduce new crops and high-class bulls, to
undertake drainage enterprises and reforestation;
and to unite on business matters.</p>

<p>It is possible for a national organization
movement to come out of the existing agricultural
institutions in the United States.</p>

<p>We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
 may picture to ourselves a perfectly co√∂perating
rural society that will have all the
means of its salvation within itself. Even if
we accept this picture, we cannot say that the
structure will rise out of one seed or starting-point,
or that one phase of co√∂peration is of
necessity primary and another final. Our theoretical
structure will arise from several or
many beginnings; it will be a complex of numberless
units; whatever range of co√∂peration is
found, by investigation, to be now most needed
in any community, must be the one with which
we are to set that community going.</p>

<p>17. In the end everything depends on <a name="personal_gumption_and_guidance" id="personal_gumption_and_guidance"></a><i>personal
gumption and guidance</i>. It is not strange
that we have lacked the kind of guidance that
brings country people together, because we
have not had the kind of education that produces
it; and, in fact, this kind of guidance
has not been so necessary in the past as it is
now. A new motive in education is gradually
beginning to shape itself. This must produce a
new kind of outlook on country questions, and
it will bring out a good many men and women
who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
 will be guides in the country as their fellows
will be guides in the city. They will be
captains because they will perform the common
work of farming regions in an uncommon way.</p>

<p>I think we little realize to-day what the effect
will be in twenty-five years of the young men
and women that the colleges of agriculture in
these days are sending into the country districts.</p>


<h3><a name="Community_interest_is_of_the_spirit" id="Community_interest_is_of_the_spirit"></a><i>Community interest is of the spirit.</i></h3>

<p>In conclusion, let us remember that everything
that develops the common commercial,
intellectual, recreative, and spiritual interests of
the rural people, ties them together socially.
Residing near together is only one of the means
of developing a community life, and it is not
now the most important one. Persons who
reside close together may still be torn asunder
by divergent interests and a simple lack of any
tie that binds; this is notably true in many
country villages.</p>

<p>Community of purpose and spirit is much
more important than community of houses.
Community pride is a good product; it produces
a common mind.</p>

<h2><a name="A_POINT_OF_VIEW_ON_THE_LABOR" id="A_POINT_OF_VIEW_ON_THE_LABOR"></a>A POINT OF VIEW ON THE LABOR
PROBLEM</h2>


<p>It is a general complaint in the United
States that there is scarcity of good labor. I
have found the same complaint in parts of
Europe, and Europeans lay much of the blame
of it on America because their working classes
migrate so much to this country; and they seem
to think we must now be well supplied with labor.
Labor scarcity is felt in the cities and trades, in
country districts, in mines, and on the sea. It
seems to be serious in regions in which there
is much unemployed population. It is a real
problem in the Southern states.</p>

<p>While farmers seem now to complain most
of the labor shortage, the difficulty is not peculiarly
rural. Good farmers feel it least; they
have mastered this problem along with other
problems. As a matter of fact, it is doubtful
whether there is a real labor shortage as measured
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
 previous periods; but it is very difficult
to secure good labor on the previous terms and
conditions.</p>


<h3><a name="Reasons_for_the_labor_question" id="Reasons_for_the_labor_question"></a><i>Reasons for the labor question.</i></h3>

<p>The supposed short labor supply is not a
temporary condition. It is one of the results
of the readjustment and movement of society.
A few of the immediate causes may be stated,
to illustrate the nature of the situation.</p>

<p>(1) In a large way, the labor problem is the
result of the passing out of the people from
slavery and serfdom,&mdash;the rise of the working
classes out of subjugation. Peoples tend always
to rise out of the laboring-man phase. We
would not have it otherwise if we desire social
democracy.</p>

<p>(2) It is due in part to the great amount
and variety of constructive work that is now
being done in the world, with the consequent
urgent call for human hands. The engineering
and building trades have extended enormously.
We are doing kinds of work that we had not
dreamed of a half-hundred years ago.</p>

<p>(3)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
 In some places the labor difficulty is
due to the working-men being drawn off to
other places, through the perfecting of industrial
organization. The organization of labor means
companionship and social attraction. Labor
was formerly solitary; it is now becoming
gregarious.</p>

<p>(4) In general, men and women go where
things are "doing." Things have not been
doing on the farms. There has been a gradual
passing out from backward or stationary occupations
into the moving occupations. Labor
has felt this movement along with the rest.
It has been natural and inevitable that farms
should have lost their labor. Cities and great
industrialism could not develop without them;
and they have made the stronger bid.</p>

<p>(5) In farming regions, the outward movement
of labor has been specially facilitated by
lack of organization there, by the introduction
of farm machinery, by the moving up of tenants
into the class of renters and owners, by
lack of continuous employment, by relatively
low pay, by absence of congenial association as
compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
 with the town. Much of the hired
farm labor is the sons of farmers and of others,
who "work out" only until they can purchase
a farm. Some of it is derived from the class
of owners who drift downward to tenants, to
laboring men, and sometimes to shifters. We
are now securing more or less foreign-born labor
on the farms. Much of this is merely seasonal;
and when it is not seasonal, the immigrant desires
to become a farm owner himself. If the
labor is seasonal, the man may return to his
native home or to the city, and in either case
he is likely to be lost to the open country.</p>


<h3><a name="The_remedies" id="The_remedies"></a><i>The remedies.</i></h3>

<p>There is really no "solution" for the labor
difficulty. The problem is inherent in the
economic and social situation. It may be relieved
here and there by the introduction of
immigrants or by transportation of laborers at
certain times from the city; but the only real
relief lies in the general working out of the
whole economic situation. The situation will
gradually correct itself; but the readjustment
will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
 come much more quickly if we understand
the conditions.</p>

<p>As new interest arises in the open country
and as additional values accrue, persons will
remain in the country or will return to it; and
the labor will remain or return with the rest.
As the open country fills up, we probably shall
develop a farm artisan class, comprised of persons
who will be skilled workmen in certain lines
of farming as other persons are skilled workmen
in manufactures and the trades. These
persons will have class pride. We now have
practically no farm artisans, but solitary and
more or less migratory working-men who
possess no high-class manual skill. Farm labor
must be able to earn as much as other labor of
equal grade, and it must develop as much skill
as other labor, if it is to hold its own. This
means, of course, that the farming scheme may
need to be reorganized <a href="#Page_86">(pages 86 to 90)</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, the farm must provide more
continuous employment if it is to hold good
labor. The farmer replies that he does not
have employment for the whole year; to which
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
 answer is that the business should be so
reorganized as to make it a twelve months'
enterprise. The introduction of crafts and
local manufactures will aid to some extent, but
it cannot take care of the situation <a href="#Page_115">(page 115)</a>.
In some way the farm laborer must be reached
educationally, either by winter schools, night
schools, or other means. Every farm should
itself be a school to train more than one laborer.
The larger part of the farm labor must be
country born. With the reorganization of
country life and its increased earning power,
we ought to see an increase in the size of
country families.</p>


<h3><a name="Public_or_social_bearings" id="Public_or_social_bearings"></a><i>Public or social bearings.</i></h3>

<p>It is doubtful if city industrialism is developing
the best type of working-men, considered
from the point of view of society <a href="#Page_59">(page 59)</a>. I
am glad of all organizations of men and women,
whether working-men or not. But it seems to
me that the emphasis in some of the organizations
has been wrongly placed. It has too
often been placed on rights rather than on
duties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
 No person and no people ever developed
by mere insistence on their rights. It is
responsibility that develops them. The working-man
owes responsibility to his employer
and to society; and so long as the present
organization of society continues he cannot
be an effective member of society unless he
has the interest of his employer constantly
in mind.</p>

<p>The real country working-men must constitute
a group quite by themselves. They cannot
be organized on the basis on which some other
folk are organized. There can be no rigid short-hour
system on a farm. The farm laborer cannot
drop his reins or leave his pitchfork in
the air when the whistle blows. He must
remain until his piece of work is completed;
this is the natural responsibility of a farm
laborer, and it is in meeting this responsibility
that he is able to rise to the upper grade and
to develop his usefulness as a citizen.</p>

<p>It is a large question whether we are to have
a distinct working-class in the country as distinguished
from the land-owning farmer. The
old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
 order is one of perfect democracy, in which
the laboring-man is a part of the farmer's family.
It is not to be expected that this condition can
continue in its old form, but the probability
is that there will always be a different relation
between working-man and employer in
the country from that which obtains in the
city. The relation will be more direct and
personal. The employer will always feel his
sense of obligation and responsibility to the man
whom he employs and to the man's family.
Persons do not starve to death in the open
country.</p>

<p>Some persons think that the farming of the
future is still to be performed on the family-plan,
by which all members of the family perform
the labor, and whatever incidental help is
employed will become for the time a part of the
family. This will probably continue to be the
rule. But we must face the fact, however, that
a necessary result of the organization of country
life and the specialization of its industries,
that is now so much urged, will be the production
of a laboring class by itself.</p>

<a name="Supervision_in_farm_labor" id="Supervision_in_farm_labor"></a><i>Supervision in farm labor.</i></h3>

<p>It is doubtful whether we shall extend the
industrial organization of labor to the open
country, and yet there should be some way of
administering farm labor. The growth of the
tendency to co√∂rdinate farming industries, in
order to overcome the disastrous effects of much
of the competitive farming, will allow for supervision
of labor, however, and will make for
efficiency. The standardizing of agricultural
practice will also do much to produce the community
mind that is so much desired <a href="#Page_97">(p. 97)</a>. On
this line, Dean H. E. Cook, who has given much
thought to labor questions, writes me as follows:</p>

<p>"The production of iron, paper, and manufactured
products generally has been standardized,
and the cost laid down in the market is
well known, and therefore placed squarely on a
cash basis. Directly the opposite is the case in
the manufacture of farm crops, and so we find
the family to be the farm crop-producers. The
wife and the children are a part of the working
force of the farm, which is not found in any
other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
 industry. In fact, our laws are very rigid
in preventing the employment of women and
children in nearly every class of work, except
on the farm. We find no provision by statute
or moral sentiment which says that the farmer
must not employ his eight- or ten-year-old boy,
as is very often the case, in most laborious
tasks. This state of affairs is not the desire of
the farmer, but has become a necessity because
of the very low prices for his products, occasioned
by the intense competition of the rapidly
extending area. Our government has taken
every means within its grasp to populate these
large areas of cheap rich land. Of course it
meant wealth to the nation, but it meant poverty
to those who had established homes and investments
in the older sections.</p>

<p>"Our methods, unlike other manufacturers
and producers, are not standardized. That is,
we find in every community persons having
each his own conception of soil-handling, crop-growing,
and marketing. In a single locality
can be found an endless variety of corn, as an
illustration. Especially is this true in the East.
Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
 corn growing fourteen feet high and
corn growing six feet high are not calculated to
bring the same results. The farmers themselves
are unlike. I suppose we are distantly removed
from the time when we shall have a uniform
type of men and women bred for the farm. It
seems to me that methods which would unify
or standardize our practices and prices&mdash;within
certain limitations, to be sure&mdash;would tend to
unify the tendencies and the type of the people.</p>

<p>"In our present state of undevelopment or
adjustment, I do not think it is possible
profitably to pursue the production of crops
with employed labor, such as we find in
our manufacturing establishments; and it may
be debatable whether that plan would be an
improvement, so far as the social life is concerned,
over the present family-plan, although
I firmly believe that the time is approaching
when the profits of the business will warrant a
cash payment for everything done on the farm.
As a connecting link between the family-plan
and the future cash-plan, it seems to me we
ought to take on in each neighborhood the
same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
 methods of supervision that are now
employed in the factories. One man of skill
and adaptability supervises the work of many.
In agriculture we have but one illustration of
this principle, namely, our butter and cheese
factories, where one man has in charge the
manufacturing of the milk of many. I think
we could profitably use a similar agency in
trucking, soil-handling, crop-growing, animal-feeding,
and general farm-management. Furthermore,
we are more in need, as the writer sees
it, of this standardizing or co√∂peration in farm-management,
than we are in the manufacture of
milk products. This plan would use the family
as a unit of labor on the farm, with the attendant
light risk, or no risk at all; and in case of failure
of crops of having to pay cash for the labor.</p>

<p>"The cow-test association is a part of this
general plan of local supervision. I can foresee
how there may come out of this cow-test
movement, a growth which will mean just what
I have tried to outline. The man who does
nothing now but the testing of the milk from
each cow may develop into an expert who will
give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
 advice on soils, crops, cow-feeding, and
other things <a href="#Page_123">(page 123)</a>.</p>

<p>"When the communities around certain
natural centers, as the cheese factories or creameries
in dairy sections, perhaps a small hamlet
in trucking sections, have become thoroughly
organized or, more properly speaking, standardized,
we shall find it comparatively easy to
bring a number of these local units together,
because the individuals who form a part of the
movement have learned the true principles
underlying co√∂peration. Until these local
units are worked out, in my opinion we shall
never be able to form any great co√∂perative
movement which will not break of its own
weight, because of a lack of annealing processes."</p>


<h3><a name="What_is_the_farmer_to_do" id="What_is_the_farmer_to_do"></a><i>What is the farmer to do?</i></h3>

<p>"How may I secure labor?" is probably the
most persistent question now asked by farmers;
but it is a question that cannot be answered,
any more than one may tell another what crops
he shall grow, what markets he shall find, or
what manner of house he shall build. This is
one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
 of the great problems of farming, as it is
of engineering, of the building trades, and of
factories. Each farmer must work it out for
himself, as he works out the problem of fertility
and machinery. He must work far ahead, and
consider it as a part of all his plans.</p>

<p>In many or most cases, it resolves itself into
a question of personality,&mdash;of making a place
that is worth while to a good man and then of
the farmer interesting himself in the man. One
can now hardly expect to secure labor on demand
for brief periods, for the scheme of things is
more and more in the direction of continuous
employment; and the old range of prices cannot
hold. If the farmer's scale of business is small
and operates only for a part of a year, he cannot
expect to secure the best and most reliable help.</p>

<p>The farmer will find increasing aid from
public labor-distributing bureaus, for these
agencies must extend with the extension of
population and the complexity of industry. In
time, the state and nation will provide competent
machinery for placing working-men
where they can best serve themselves and society,
thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
 relieving both employer and employed
from much waste of effort. As farm
labor is not a separate difficulty, the problem
will tend to better and better solution along
with the rest. If the distributing agencies are
not now wholly satisfactory, the farmer must
recognize that they are only beginning, and that
he should co√∂perate with them. The problem
of utilizing the immigrant, for example, is one
of distribution; but distribution is really not
accomplished merely by sending a certain number
of immigrants to a certain number of places,&mdash;immigrant
and employer must find the situation
to be mutually satisfactory.</p>

<p>Any effort which assumes that labor must
necessarily come to the old-type farm, is only
temporary. The farm must readjust itself to
meet the labor problem. In the meantime,
through the labor bureaus, by looking long
ahead, by organizing a labor club in the community,
by some person acting as a labor agent
and supplying farmers as they need, by trying
to make a year-round activity in the neighborhood,
the situation may be met more or less.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_MIDDLEMAN_QUESTION" id="THE_MIDDLEMAN_QUESTION"></a>THE MIDDLEMAN QUESTION</h2>


<p>To make farming profitable is no longer a
question merely of raising more produce. We
have passed that point. We now have knowledge
and experience enough to enable us greatly
to increase our yields, if only we put the knowledge
into practice.</p>


<h3><a name="Farmer_does_not_get_his_share" id="Farmer_does_not_get_his_share"></a><i>Farmer does not get his share.</i></h3>

<p>But the farmer, speaking broadly, does not
get his share of the proceeds of his labor, notwithstanding
the increase in the price of farm
products. A few farmers here and there, producing
a superior article and favored by location
or otherwise, can be quite independent of
marketing systems; but the larger number of
farmers never can be so situated, and they must
grow the staples, and they are now at the
mercy of many intermediaries. The farmer's
risks, to say nothing of his investment and his
labor, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
 not sufficiently taken into account in
our scheme of business,&mdash;risks of bad years,
storm, frost, flood, disease to stock and crop,
and many things over which he has practically
no control.</p>

<p>A merchant in a small city may want as much
as twenty per cent commission to sell produce,
and then retain the privilege of returning to the
grower all the product that spoils on his hands
or that he is unable to sell; he invests little
capital, takes no risk, and makes more than
the man who buys his land, prepares the crop
months in advance, and assumes every risk
from seed-time to dinner-table. I am citing
this case not to say that it is a subject for
public control nor even to assert that the merchant's
commission is intrinsically too great, but
only to illustrate the disadvantage in which the
farmer often finds himself; and the farmer may
even have no escape from this disadvantage, for
all the merchants within his market region may
agree to sell his produce only on such terms,
and he may be obliged to accept these terms
or not to sell his wares.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
 manufacturer knows the cost of his
products and charges his price. The farmer
usually does not know the cost, and in general
he makes no selling price; the prices of his
staple produce are made for him.</p>

<p>That the producer does not secure his proportionate
share of the selling price in many
products is a matter of the commonest knowledge,
and much study has been made of the
question. If the question is put in another way,
the consumer pays too great a margin, in great
numbers of cases, over the cost of production.
The following press item, coming to my hand
as I write, is an example (given for what it is
worth), although not extreme: "The government
of New York, and not the government
in Washington, is where the people of this
city must look, if they expect to see reduction
in living expenses. A bushel of beans,
for which the producer in Florida receives
$2.25, with the transportation 50 cents for the
800-mile haul, should not cost the New York
consumer $6.40 a bushel. The producer receives
35 per cent of the final price, the transporter
8<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
 per cent, and the dealers 57 per cent.
This is not a fair division. The problem is
not one of trusts, tariffs, and other Washington
matters, but simply one of providing straight
and cheap ways open from all gardens and
farms to kitchens and tables."</p>

<p>The poorer the country or the less forehanded
the people, the harder is the pinch of
the usurer and the trader, and all the machinery
of trade is likely to be manipulated against the
defenseless man who stands stolidly between
the handles of the plow.</p>

<p>Of course, such conditions do not obtain
with all products. In some of the great staples,
as wheat, the cost of transportation and
commissions is often reduced by competition
and scientific handling to probably its lowest
terms. But that there are abuses and extortions,
and remediable conditions, in the middleman
system&mdash;by which I mean collectively all
traders between producer and consumer&mdash;no
one will attempt to deny. The farmer cannot
rise to his proper place until the stones are
taken off his back.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
 abuses must be checked and discriminations
removed, whether in the middleman trade
itself, rates of express companies and other carriers,
or stock-market gambling. The middleman
system has had a free field to play in, the
wealth of the country to handle; it has exercised
its license, and in too many cases it has become
parasitic, either protected by law and custom
or unreachable by law or custom. It is a shame
that our economic machinery is not capable of
handling the situation.</p>


<h3><a name="Relation_of_the_question_to_cost-of-living" id="Relation_of_the_question_to_cost-of-living"></a><i>Relation of the question to cost-of-living.</i></h3>

<p>It is customary just now to attribute the
high cost of living to lessened production due
to a supposed decline of agriculture, and to advise,
therefore, that more persons engage in
farming for the purpose of increasing the product.
This position is met by an editorial of
the New York Tribune, which holds that
intermediary trading combinations are responsible:</p>

<p>"It is true that the raising of cattle for
the market has almost ceased in the East and
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
 agriculture generally has not kept pace
with the demand for food products. Yet it is
hard to believe that agriculture in any part of
the Union would steadily decline in the face of
an enormous appreciation of the cost to the
consumer of all farm products, were there not
some powerful disturbing factor operating to
deny the farmer the benefits of that appreciation.
If the Eastern farmer could have reaped
a legitimate share of the increase in the price
of farm produce which has taken place in the
last twenty years, he would certainly be in position
to command all the labor he needs and to
develop resources now neglected because it
does not pay to develop them. Under normal
conditions economic law would certainly drive
labor and energy into a field of production in
which there had been the greatest relative expansion
in the selling price of products.</p>

<p>"Yet economic law has not operated to stimulate
agriculture, because the returns from steadily
mounting prices have not really reached the
producer. Thirty years ago the fattening of
steers for the local markets was common in the
East.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
 But when the vast Western ranges were
opened, and the great packing houses were
established, the cheapness of range beef, refrigerated
and delivered in Eastern cities, was used
as a weapon to kill off the cattle industry of
the East. When the Eastern cattleman was
driven out of business, the price of beef rose,
but virtually all the increase has gone to the
packing combinations, which fix their own price
to the Western range man and their own price
to the consumer and artificially control the supply
so as to discourage increased production in
the West and to prevent a revival of production
in the East. The country is growing in
population at the rate of twenty to twenty-five
per cent each decade. But Secretary Wilson
has shown that the supply of food animals is
not being maintained in proportion to population.
In the last decade cattle have remained
about stationary in numbers, swine are actually
decreasing, and, while more sheep are available,
the supply has diminished relatively to population.</p>

<p>"It can hardly be contended that with steadily
diminishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
 supplies and steadily increasing
prices the law of supply and demand would not
work out a new balance, stimulating production
through easy profits, were there no artificial interception
of the producer's normal share of the
advance in price. Were there a free market for
the Eastern raiser of stock, milk, and food
products generally, with the middleman's commissions
properly restricted, Eastern farming
would probably be profitable enough to hold
its own against manufacturing and to compete
successfully with the manufacturer for
labor."</p>


<h3><a name="The_farmers_part" id="The_farmers_part"></a><i>The farmer's part.</i></h3>

<p>Of course, it is necessary to teach every
farmer how to grow more crops, for this is his
business, and it also enlarges his personal ambition
and extends his power and responsibility;
but merely to grow the crops will not
avail,&mdash;this is only the beginning of the problem:
the products must be distributed and
marketed in such a way that the one who expends
the effort to produce them shall receive
enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
 of the return to identify him with the
effort. Thereafter, social and moral results
will follow.</p>


<h3><a name="The_middlemans_part" id="The_middlemans_part"></a><i>The middleman's part.</i></h3>

<p>I recognize the service of the middleman
to society. I know that the distributor and
trader are producers of wealth as well as those
who raise the raw materials; but this is no
justification for abuses. I know that there
are hosts of perfectly honest and dependable
middlemen. We do not yet know whether
the existing system of intermediary distributors
and sellers is necessary to future society,
but we do not see any other practicable way
at present. In special cases, the farmer may
reach his own customer; but this condition,
as I have suggested, is so small in proportion
to the whole number of farmers as not greatly
to affect the general situation. We do not
yet see any way whereby all farmers can be so
organized as to enable them to control all
their own marketing. Therefore, we must
recognize middleman-practice as legitimate.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
<a name="A_system_of_economic_waste" id="A_system_of_economic_waste"></a><i>A system of economic waste.</i></h3>

<p>But even though we yet see no way of general
escape from the system, we ought to provide
some means of regulating its operation. The
present method of placing agricultural produce
in the hands of the consumer is for the most
part indirect and wasteful. Probably in the majority
of cases of dissatisfaction, the person whom
we call the middleman does not receive any exorbitant
profit, but the cost of the commodities
is piled up by a long and circuitous system of
intermediate tolls and commissions.</p>


<h3><a name="Cooperation_of_farmers_will_not_solve_it" id="Cooperation_of_farmers_will_not_solve_it"></a><i>Co√∂peration of farmers will not solve it.</i></h3>

<p>It is commonly advised that farmers "unite"
or "organize" to correct middleman and transportation
abuses, but these troubles cannot be
solved by any combination of farmers, because
this is not an agricultural question. It is as
much a problem for consumers as for producers.
It is a part of the civilization of our
day, completely woven into the fabric of our
economic system. The farmer may feel its
hardship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
 first because he must bear it, while
the consumer, to meet higher prices, demands
more pay of his employer or takes another
stitch out of somebody else. But it is essentially
a problem for all society to solve, not for
farmers alone, particularly when it operates on
a continental basis. This also indicates the
futility of the arbitrary control of prices of
the great staples by combinations of farmers
<a href="#Page_126">(page 126)</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, temporary or local relief may be
secured by organizations of producers here and
there, or of consumers here and there (probably
consumers can attack the problem more effectively
than producers), and by the establishment
of public markets; but no organization can
permanently handle the question unless the
organization is all the people.</p>

<p>The present agitations against middleman
practices and stock-market gambling ought to
compel Congress to pass laws to correct the
evils that are correctable by law, and the organizations
then should keep such touch on
the situation that the laws will be enforced.</p>

<p>It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
 has been suggested that the superabundant
middlemen go into farming; but no one
can compel them to go to farming, and they
might not be successful farmers if they should
attack the business, and the farming country
might not need them or profit by them,&mdash;for
it is not demonstrated that we need more
farmers, although it is apparent that we need
better farmers.</p>


<h3><a name="It_is_the_business_of_government" id="It_is_the_business_of_government"></a><i>It is the business of government.</i></h3>

<p>It is the business of any government to protect
its people. Governments have protected
their countries from invasion and war, but the
greatest office of government in modern times
is to develop its own people and the internal
resources of its realm. We are beginning to
protect the people from the over-lording of
railroads, from unfair combinations in trade,
and from the tyranny of organized politicians.
It is just as much the business of government
to protect its people from dishonest and tyrannous
middlemen lying beyond the practical
reach of individuals. The situation has arisen
because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
 of lack of control; there is no conspiracy
against the farmer.</p>

<p>It is said that competition will in the end
correct the middleman evil, but competition
does not correct it; and competition alone,
under the present structure of society, will
not correct it in most cases because "agreements"
between traders restrict or remove competition:
the situation does not have within
itself the remedies for its own ills.</p>

<p>When we finally eliminate combinations in
restraint of trade, the middleman abuses may
be in the process of passing out. It is to check
dishonesty on the one hand and to allow real
competition on the other that I am now making
suggestions.</p>


<h3><a name="Must_be_a_continuing_process_of_control" id="Must_be_a_continuing_process_of_control"></a><i>Must be a continuing process of control.</i></h3>

<p>I have no suggestion to make as to the nature
of the laws themselves. There are many diverse
situations to be met; and I intentionally do not
make my remarks specific. Of course, any law
that really attempts to reach the case must recognize
the middleman as exercising a public or semi-public
function,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
 and that, as such, he is amenable
to control, even beyond the point of mere
personal honesty. The licensing of middlemen
(a practice that might be carried much further,
and which is a first step in reform) recognizes
this status; and if it is competent for government
to license a middleman, it is also competent
for it to exercise some oversight over him.
It is not necessary that government declare
an agency a monopoly in order to regulate it.
Commercial situations that unmistakably involve
service to the public are proper for governmental
control in greater or lesser degree. The supervision
of weights and measures is a good beginning
in the regulation of middleman trading.</p>

<p>But the enactment of laws, even of good
laws, is only another step in the solution. A
law does not operate itself, and the common
man cannot resort to courts of law to secure
justice in such cases as these. There must be
a <i>continuing process</i> of government with which to
work out the reform and to adjust each case on its
merits. Whatever the merits of the laws, their
success lies in the continuing application of them
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
 specific cases by persons whose business it is
to discern the facts rather than to prove a case.</p>

<p>There are three steps in the control of the
middleman: (1) an aroused public conscience
on the question; (2) good fundamental laws
for interstate phases and similar state laws for
local phases; (3) good commissions or other
agencies or bodies to which any producer or
consumer or middleman may take his case, and
which may exercise regulatory functions. The
interstate commerce commission has jurisdiction
over so much of the problem as relates to the
service and rates of common carriers; no doubt,
its powers could be extended to other interstate
phases. Perhaps departments of agriculture, in
states in which public service commissions have
not been established, could be given sufficient
scope to handle some of the questions.</p>

<p>Of course, some of the middlemen and associated
traders will contend that all this interferes
with business and with private rights, but no
man has a private right to oppress or defraud
another or to deprive him of his proper rewards;
and we must correct a faulty economic system.
There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
 is little danger that the legitimate business
of any honest middleman will be interfered with.</p>

<p>I know that commissions and similar bodies
have not always been wholly successful. This
is because we have not yet had experience
enough, have not consciously trained our people
for this kind of work, and have not been
able to make water-tight laws. Neither do
older systems now prove to be adequate.
New economic conditions must bring new
methods of regulation and control.</p>

<p>I have no desire that society (or government)
engage in the middleman business or that it
take over private enterprise; but no government
can expect to throw back on the producer
the responsibility of controlling the middleman.
I look for the present agitation to awaken government
to the necessity of doing what it is
plainly its duty to do. In future, a government
that will not protect its people in those cases
in which the people, acting to the best of their
individual and co√∂perating capacity, cannot protect
themselves, will be known as either a bad
government or an undeveloped government.</p>

<h2><a name="COUNTY_AND_LOCAL_FAIRS" id="COUNTY_AND_LOCAL_FAIRS"></a>COUNTY AND LOCAL FAIRS</h2>


<p>Much is said about the necessity of redirecting
rural institutions. The fairs are mentioned
among the rest. I shall now indicate an experiment
that might be tried with existing county and
local fairs, not only as a suggestion for the fairs
themselves, but as an illustration of how completely
it is possible to reconstruct an institution
that is long established in conventional
methods.</p>

<p>I do not think a fair that carries only one or
two weeks' interest during the year is justifiable;
but of this aspect of the question I am not now
speaking.</p>


<h3><a name="Nature_of_the_fair" id="Nature_of_the_fair"></a><i>Nature of the fair.</i></h3>

<p>The county fair has not changed its general
basis of operation in recent years, and yet the
basis of country life is changing rapidly. Many
fairs are doing excellent work and are worth
to the people all that they cost in effort and
money;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
 but the whole plan of the county fair
is insufficient for the epoch that we are now
entering. I should not discontinue the local
fairs: I should make them over.</p>

<p>The fairs have been invaded by gambling,
and numberless catch-penny and amusement
and entertainment features, many of which are
very questionable, until they often become great
country medleys of acrobats and trained bears
and high-divers and gew-gaws and balloon
ascensions and side-shows and professional traveling
exhibitors and advertising devices for all
kinds of goods. The receipts are often measured
by the number of cheap vaudeville and
other "attractions" that the fair is able to
secure. And as these things have increased,
the local agricultural interest has tended to drop
out. In some cases the state makes appropriations
to local fairs; it is a question whether
the state should be in the showman business.</p>

<p>I should like to see one experiment tried
somewhere by some one, designed to project
a bold enterprise on a new foundation. It
would first be necessary to eliminate some of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
 present features, and then to add a constructive
program.</p>


<h3><a name="Features_to_be_eliminated" id="Features_to_be_eliminated"></a><i>Features to be eliminated.</i></h3>

<p>I should eliminate all gate receipts; all horse
trots; all concessions and all shows; all display
of ordinary store merchandise; all sales
of articles and commodities; and all money
premiums.</p>


<h3><a name="Constructive_program" id="Constructive_program"></a><i>Constructive program.</i></h3>

<p>Having taken out the obstructions, unnecessaries,
and excrescences, I should enter on
a constructive program. I should then begin
to make a fair. I assume that the fact of a
person living in a community, places on him
responsibilities for the welfare of that community.
We should make the county fair one of
the organized means of developing this welfare.
Therefore, I should assume that every citizen
in the county, by virtue of his citizenship, is a
member of the county fair and owes to it an
allegiance.</p>

<p>It would then devolve on the persons who
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
 organizing and operating the work, representing
the fair association, to develop in him
his sense of allegiance and co√∂peration. I
should not discourage any citizen of the county
from co√∂perating in the enterprise, or allow
him to escape his natural responsibilities, because
he felt himself unable or unwilling to
pay an admission fee, any more than I should
eliminate any person because of religion, politics,
color, or sex.</p>


<h3><a name="The_financial_support" id="The_financial_support"></a><i>The financial support.</i></h3>

<p>Of course, it requires money to run a fair.
I should like to see the money raised by voluntary
contribution in a new way. I should
have it said to every resident in the county
that he and his family may come uninterruptedly
to the fair without money and without
price; but I should also say to him that money
is needed, and that all those persons who wish
to give a certain sum would be provided with
a badge or receipt. I suspect that more money
could be more easily raised in this way than by
means of gate receipts.</p>

<p>I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
 should have this money collected in advance
by means of an organized effort through
all the schools and societies in the county, setting
every one of them at work on a definite
plan.</p>

<p>Of course, the state or other agency could
contribute its quota of funds as theretofore.</p>


<h3><a name="An_educational_basis" id="An_educational_basis"></a><i>An educational basis.</i></h3>

<p>In other words, I should like to see, in this
single experiment, a complete transfer from the
commercial and "amusement" phase to the
educational and recreation phase. I should like
to see the county fair made the real meeting
place for the country folk. I should make a
special effort to get the children. The best
part of the fair would be the folks, and not the
machines or the cattle, although these also
would be very important. I should make the
fair one great picnic and gathering-place and
field-day, and bring together the very best
elements that are concerned in the development
of country life.</p>

<p>I should work through every organized
enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
 in the county, as commercial clubs,
creameries, co√∂perative associations, religious
bodies, fraternal organizations, insurance societies,
schools, and whatever other organized
units already may exist.</p>

<p>It is often said that our fairs have developed
from the market-places of previous times, and
are historically commercial. We know, of
course, that fairs have been market-places, and
that some of them are so to this day in other
countries. I doubt very much, however,
whether the history is correct that develops
the American agricultural fair from the market-place
fairs of other countries. From the time
when Elkanah Watson exhibited his merino
sheep in the public square of Pittsfield, Massachusetts,
in 1807, in order that he might
induce other persons to grow sheep as good as
his, and when the state of New York started
its educational program in 1819, the essence
of the American idea has been that a fair is an
educational and not a trading enterprise. But
whatever the history, the agricultural fair maintained
by public money owes its obligation to the
people and not to commercial interests.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<a name="Ask_every_person_to_prove_up" id="Ask_every_person_to_prove_up"></a><i>Ask every person to prove up.</i></h3>

<p>I should have every person bring and exhibit
what he considers to be his best contribution
to the development of a good country life.</p>

<p>One man would exhibit his bushel of potatoes;
another his Holstein bull; another his
pumpkin or his plate of apples; another a picture
and plans of his modern barn; another
his driving team; another his flock of sheep
or his herd of swine; another his pen of poultry;
another his plan for a new house or a
sanitary kitchen, or for the installation of
water-supplies, or for the building of a farm
bridge, or the improved hanging of a barn
door, or for a better kind of fence, or for a
new kink in a farm harness, or the exhibition
of tools best fitted for clay land or sandy land,
and so on and on.</p>

<p>The woman would also show what she is
contributing to better conditions,&mdash;her best
handiwork in fabrics, her best skill in cooking,
her best plans in housekeeping, her best ideas
for church work or for club work.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
 children would show their pets, what
they had grown in the garden, what they had
made in the house or the barn, what they had
done in the school, what they had found in the
woods.</p>

<p>I should assume that every person living
on the land in the country has some one thing
that he is sure is a contribution to better farming,
or to better welfare; and he should be
encouraged to exhibit it and to explain it,
whether it is a new way to hang a hoe, or a
herd of pure-bred cattle, or a plan for farmers'
institutes. I should challenge every man to
show in what respect he has any right to claim
recognition over his fellows, or to be a part of
his community.</p>

<p>I should ask the newspapers and the agricultural
press to show up their work; also the
manufacturers of agricultural implements and
of country-life articles of all kinds.</p>

<p>I should also ask the organizations to prove
up. What is the creamery contributing to a
better country life? What the school? The
church? The grange? The co√∂perative exchange?
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
 farmers' club? The reading
club? The woman's society? The literary
circle? The library? The commercial clubs?
The hunting or sportsman's clubs?</p>


<h3><a name="Sports_contests_and_pageants" id="Sports_contests_and_pageants"></a><i>Sports, contests, and pageants.</i></h3>

<p>I should give much attention to the organization
of good games and sports, and I should
have these co√∂perative between schools, or
other organizations, such organizations having
prepared for them consecutively during the
preceding year. I should introduce good contests
of all kinds. I should fill the fair with
good fun and frolic.</p>

<p>I should want to see some good pageants
and dramatic efforts founded on the industries,
history, or traditions of the region or at least
of the United States. It would not be impossible
to find simple literature for such exercises
even now, for a good deal has been written.
By song, music, speaking, acting, and various
other ways, it would not be difficult to get all
the children in the schools of the county at
work. In the old days of the school "exhibition,"
something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
 of this spirit prevailed. It
was manifest in the old "spelling bees" and
also in the "lyceum." We have lost our
rural cohesion because we have been attracted
by the town and the city, and we have allowed
the town and the city to do our work. I think
it would not be difficult to organize a pageant,
or something of the kind, at a county fair, that
would make the ordinary vaudeville or sideshow
or gim-crack look cheap and ridiculous
and not worth one's while.</p>


<h3><a name="Premiums" id="Premiums"></a><i>Premiums.</i></h3>

<p>If we organize our fair on a recreation and
educational basis, then we can take out all
commercial phases, as the paying of money
premiums. An award of merit, if it is nothing
more than a certificate or a memento, would then
be worth more than a hundred dollars in money.
So far as possible, I should substitute co√∂peration
and emulation for competition, particularly
for competition for money.</p>

<p>It is probable that the fair would have to
assume the expense of certain of the exhibits.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<a name="It_is_time_to_begin" id="It_is_time_to_begin"></a><i>It is time to begin.</i></h3>

<p>This kind of fair is not only perfectly possible,
but it is feasible in many places, if only
some one or two or three persons possessed of
good common sense and of leadership would
take hold of the thing energetically. One
must cut himself loose from preconceived
notions and probably from the regular fair
associations. He must have imagination, and
be prepared to meet discouragements. He
need not take the attitude that present methods
are necessarily all bad; he is merely concerned
in developing a new thing.</p>

<p>Because I should not have horse races in
my fair, I do not wish at all to be understood
as saying that horse races are to be prohibited.
Let the present race courses in the
fair grounds be used for horse races, if the
people want them. We have June races now,
and they could be held at other times of the
year when persons who are interested desire to
have them. My point is that they are not an
essential part of a county agricultural fair.
They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
 rest on a money basis, and do not represent
the people. Neither do I say that all
traveling shows and concessions are bad; but
most of them are out of place in a county fair
and contrary to its spirit.</p>

<p>If the horse races were organized for the purpose
of developing the horses of the county,
then I should admit them; but I should give
them only their proportionate place along with
other means of developing horse-stock,&mdash;as
of work horses, farm horses, draft horses, driving
horses.</p>


<h3><a name="The_fair_ground" id="The_fair_ground"></a><i>The fair ground.</i></h3>

<p>An enterprise of the kind that I project
need not necessarily be held on a fair-ground
of the present type, although that might be the
best place for it. If there is a good institution
in the county that has grounds, and especially
that has an agricultural equipment worthy of
observation, I should think that the best results
would be secured by holding the fair at
that place. This kind of a fair would not need to
be inclosed within a Chinese wall. Of course,
there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
 would have to be buildings and booths
and stables in which exhibitions could be made.</p>

<p>In every fair there should nowadays be an
assembly hall in which lectures, exhibitions,
simple dramas, worth-while applicable moving
pictures, and other entertainment features can
be given.</p>


<h3><a name="My_plea" id="My_plea"></a><i>My plea.</i></h3>

<p>My plea, therefore, is that some one somewhere
make one experiment with a county fair
designed to bring all the people together on a
wholly new idea. The present basis is wrong
for this twentieth century. The old needs are
passing; new needs are coming in. I should
have the fair represent the real substantial
progress of rural civilization, and I should also
have it help to make that progress. It should
be a power in its community, not a phenomenon
that passes as a matter of course, like the
phases of the moon.</p>

<p>I do not expect all this to materialize in a
day; but I want to set a new picture into my
readers' minds.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="THE_COUNTRY-LIFE_PHASE_OF" id="THE_COUNTRY-LIFE_PHASE_OF"></a>THE COUNTRY-LIFE PHASE OF
CONSERVATION</h2>


<p>The conservation movement is the expression
of the idea that the materials and agencies
that are part of the furniture of the planet are
to be utilized by each generation carefully, and
with real regard to the welfare of those who are
to follow us. The country-life movement is
the expression of the idea that the policies,
efforts, and material well-being of the open
country must be highly sustained, as a fundamental
essential of a good civilization; and it
recognizes the fact that rural society has made
relatively less progress in the past century than
has urban society. Both movements are immediately
economic, but in ultimate results they
are social and moral. They rest on the assumption
that the welfare of the individual man and
woman is to be conserved and developed, and
is the ultimate concern of governments; both,
therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
 are phases in a process of social
evolution.</p>

<p>These are the twin policies of the Roosevelt
administration, an economic and social movement
for which that administration will be first
remembered after the incidents and personalities
of the time have lost their significance.</p>

<p>Not only the welfare but the existence of
the race depends on utilizing the products
and forces of the planet wisely, and also on
securing greater quantity and variety of new
products. These are finally the most fundamental
movements that government has yet
attempted to attack; for when the products
of the earth shall begin to disappear or the arm
of the husbandman to lose its skill, there is an
end to the office of government. At the bottom,
therefore, the conservation and country-life
movements rest on the same premise; but
in their operation and in the problems that are
before them they are so distinct that they should
not be confounded or united. These complementary
phases may best work themselves
out by separate organization and machinery,
although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
 articulating at every point; and this
would be true if for no other reason than that a
different class of persons, and a different method
of procedure, attach to each movement. The
conservation movement finds it necessary, as
a starting-point, to attack intrenched property
interests, and it therefore discovers itself in politics,
inasmuch as these interests have become
intrenched through legislation. The country-life
movement lacks these personal and political
aspects, and proceeds rather on a broad policy of
definite education and of redirection of imagination.</p>


<h3><a name="These_subjects_have_a_history" id="These_subjects_have_a_history"></a><i>These subjects have a history.</i></h3>

<p>Neither conservation nor country life is
new except in name and as the subject of an
organized movement. The end of the original
resources has been foreseen from time out of
mind, and prophetic books have been written
on the subject. The need of a quickened
country life has been recognized from the time
that cities began to dominate civilization; and
the outlook of the high-minded countryman has
been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
 depicted from the days of the classical
writings until now. On the side of mineral
and similar resources, the geologists amongst
us have made definite efforts for conservation;
and on the side of soil fertility the agricultural
chemists and the teachers of agriculture have
for a hundred years maintained a perpetual
campaign of conservation. So long and persistently
have those persons in the agricultural
and some other institutions heard these questions
emphasized, that the startling assertions of
the present day as to the failure of our resources
and the co√∂rdinate importance of rural affairs
with city affairs have not struck me with any
force of novelty.</p>

<p>But there comes a time when the warnings
begin to collect themselves, and to crystallize
about definite points; and my purpose in
suggesting this history is to emphasize the importance
of the two formative movements
now before us by showing that the roots run
deep back into human experience. It is no
ephemeral or transitory subject that we are
now to discuss.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<a name="They_are_not_party-politics_subjects" id="They_are_not_party-politics_subjects"></a><i>They are not party-politics subjects.</i></h3>

<p>I have said that these are economic and
social problems and policies. I wish to enlarge
this view. They are concerned with saving,
utilizing, and augmenting, and only secondarily
with administration. We must first ascertain
the facts as to our resources, and from this
groundwork impress the subject on the people.
The subject must be approached by scientific
methods. The "political" phase, although
probably necessary, is only temporary, till we
remove impedimenta and clear the way.</p>

<p>It would be unfortunate if such movement
became the exclusive program of a political
party, for then the question would become
partisan and probably be removed from calm
or judicial consideration, and the opposition
would equally become the program of a party.
Every last citizen should be naturally interested
in the careful utilization of our native materials
and wealth, and it is due him that the details
of the question be left open for unbiased discussion
rather than to be made the arbitrary
program,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
 either one way or another, of a political
organization. Conservation is in the end
a plain problem involving economic, educational,
and social situations, rather than a political issue.</p>

<p>The country-life movement is equally a
scientific problem, in the sense that it must be
approached in the scientific spirit. It will be
inexcusable in this day if we do not go at the
subject with only the desire to discover the
facts and to arrive at a rational solution, by
non-political methods.</p>


<h3><a name="The_soil_is_the_greatest_of_all_resources" id="The_soil_is_the_greatest_of_all_resources"></a><i>The soil is the greatest of all resources.</i></h3>

<p>The resources that sustain the race are of
two kinds,&mdash;those that lie beyond the power
of man to reproduce or increase, and those that
may be augmented by propagation and by care.
The former are the mines of minerals, metals,
and coal, the water, the air, the sunshine; the
latter are the living resources, in crop and live-stock.</p>

<p>Intermediate between the two classes stands
the soil, on which all living resources depend.
While the soil is part of the mineral and earthy
resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
 of the planet, it nevertheless can be
increased in its producing power. Even after
all minerals and metals and coal are depleted,
the race may sustain itself in comfort and progress
so long as the soil is productive, provided,
of course, that water and air and sunshine are
still left to us. The greatest of all resources
that man can make or mar is the soil. Beyond
all the mines of coal and all the precious ores,
this is the heritage that must be most carefully
saved; and this, in particular, is the country-life
phase of the conservation movement.</p>

<p>To my mind, the conservation movement
has not sufficiently estimated or emphasized
this problem. It has laid stress, I know, on
the enormous loss by soil erosion and has said
something of inadequate agricultural practice,
but the main question is yet practically untouched
by the movement,&mdash;the plain problem
of handling the soil by all the millions who, by
skill or blundering or theft, produce crops and
animals out of the earth. Peoples have gone
down before the lessening fertility of the land,
and in all probability other peoples will yet go
down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
 The course of empire has been toward
the unplundered lands.</p>


<h3><a name="The_soil_crust" id="The_soil_crust"></a><i>The soil crust.</i></h3>

<p>Thinner than a skin of an apple is the
covering of the earth that a man tills. The
marvelously slight layer that the farmer knows
as "the soil," supports all plants and all men,
and makes it possible for the globe to sustain
a highly developed life. Beyond all calculation
and all comprehension are the powers and
the mysteries of this soft outer covering of the
earth. For all we know, the stupendous mass
of materials of which the planet is composed
is wholly dead, and only on the surface does
any nerve of life quicken it into a living sphere.
And yet, from this attenuated layer have come
numberless generations of giants of forests and
of beasts, perhaps greater in their combined
bulk than all the soil from which they have
come; and back into this soil they go, until
the great life principle catches up their disorganized
units and builds them again into beings
as complex as themselves.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
 general evolution of this soil is toward
greater powers; and yet, so nicely balanced are
these powers that within his lifetime a man may
ruin any part of it that society allows him to
hold; and in despair he throws it back to
nature to reinvigorate and to heal. We are
accustomed to think of the power of man in
gaining dominion over the forces of nature,&mdash;he
bends to his use the expansive powers of
steam, the energy of the electric current, and
he ranges through space in the light that he
concentrates in his telescope; but while he is
doing all this, he sets at naught the powers in
the soil beneath his feet, wastes them, and deprives
himself of vast sources of energy. Man
will never gain dominion until he learns
from nature how to maintain the augmenting
powers of the disintegrating crust of the
earth.</p>

<p>We can do little to control or modify the
atmosphere or the sunlight; but the epidermis
of the earth is ours to do with it much as we
will. It is the one great earth-resource over
which we have dominion. The soil may be
made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
 better as well as worse, more as well as
less; and to save the producing powers of it is
far and away the most important consideration
in the conservation of natural resources.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to devise a
system of farm accounting that shall accurately
represent the loss in producing power of the
land (or depreciation in actual capital stock).
The rising sentiment on the fertility question
is just now reflected in the proposal to ask
Congress and the states to make it a misdemeanor
for a man to rob his land and to lay
out for him a farm scheme. This is a chimerical
notion; but the people are bound to express
themselves unmistakably in some way on
this subject.</p>

<p>Even if we should ultimately find that crops
do not actually deplete land by the removal of
stored plant-food in the way in which we have
been taught, it is nevertheless true that poor
management ruins its productivity; and whatever
the phrase we use in our speaking and
writing, we shall still need to hold the land-usurer
to account.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<a name="No_man_has_a_right_to_plunder_the_soil" id="No_man_has_a_right_to_plunder_the_soil"></a><i>No man has a right to plunder the soil.</i></h3>

<p>The man who tills and manages the soil
owes a real obligation to his fellow-men for the
use that he makes of his land; and his fellow-men
owe an equal obligation to him to see
that his lot in society is such that he will not
be obliged to rob the earth in order to
maintain his life. The natural resources of the
earth are the heritage and the property of
every one and all of us. A man has no moral
right to skin the earth, unless he is forced to
do it in sheer self-defense and to enable him to
live in some epoch of an unequally developed
society; and if there are or have been such
social epochs, then is society itself directly
responsible for the waste of the common heritage.
We have given every freeholder the
privilege to destroy his farm.</p>

<p>The man who plunders the soil is in very
truth a robber, for he takes that which is not
his own, and he withholds bread from the
mouths of generations yet to be born. No
man really owns his acres: society allows him
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
 use of them for his lifetime, but the fee
comes back to society in the end. What, then,
will society do with those persons who rob
society? The pillaging land-worker must be
brought to account and be controlled, even
as we control other offenders.</p>

<p>I have no socialistic program to propose.
The man who is to till the land must be educated:
there is more need, on the side of the
public welfare, to educate this man than any
other man whatsoever <a href="#Page_36">(page 36)</a>. When he
knows, and his obligations to society are quickened,
he will be ready to become a real conservator;
and he will act energetically as soon as the
economic pressure for land-supplies begins to
be acute. When society has done all it can
to make every farmer a voluntary conservator
of the fatness of the earth, it will probably be
obliged to resort to other means to control the
wholly incompetent and the recalcitrant; at
least, it will compel the soil-robber to remove
to other occupation, if economic stress does not
itself compel it. We shall reach the time when
we shall not allow a man to till the earth unless
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
 is able to leave it at least as fertile as he
found it.</p>

<p>I do not think that our natural soil resources
have yet been greatly or permanently depleted,
speaking broadly; and such depletion as has
occurred has been the necessary result of the
conquest of a continent. But a new situation
will confront us, now that we see the end of
our raw conquest; and the old methods cannot
hold for the future. The conquest has produced
great and strong folk, and we have been
conserving men while we have been free with
our resources. In the future, we shall produce
strong folk by the process of thoroughness and
care.</p>


<h3><a name="Ownership_vs_conservation" id="Ownership_vs_conservation"></a><i>Ownership</i> vs. <i>conservation</i>.</h3>

<p>This discussion leads me to make an application
to the conservation movement in general.
We are so accustomed to think of privileged
interests and of corporation control of resources
that we are likely to confuse conservation and
company ownership. The essence of conservation
is to utilize our resources with no waste,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
 with an honest care for the children of all
the generations. But we state the problem to
be the reservation of our resources for all the
people, and often assume that if all the resources
were in private ownership the problem would
thereby be solved; but, in fact, the conservation
question is one thing and the ownership
of property quite another. A corporation may
be the best as well as the worst conservator
of resources; and likewise, private or individual
ownership may be the very worst as well as the
best conservator. The individual owner, represented
by the "independent farmer," may be
the prince of monopolists, even though his
operations compass a very small scale. The
very fact that he is independent and that he is
intrenched behind the most formidable of all
barriers&mdash;private property rights&mdash;insure his
monopoly.</p>

<p>In the interest of pure conservation, it is just
as necessary to control the single men as the
organized men. In the end, conservation must
deal with the separate or the individual man;
that is, with a person. It matters not whether
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
 person is a part of a trust, or lives alone a
hundred miles beyond the frontier, or is the
owner of a prosperous farm,&mdash;if he wastes the
heritage of the race, he is an offender.</p>

<p>We are properly devising ways whereby the
corporation holds its property or privileges in
trust, returning to government (or to society) a
fair rental; that is, we are making it responsible
to the people. What shall we do with the
unattached man, to make him also responsible?
Shall we hold the corporate plunderer to strict
account, and let the single separate plunderer
go scot-free?</p>


<h3><a name="The_philosophy_of_saving" id="The_philosophy_of_saving"></a><i>The philosophy of saving.</i></h3>

<p>The conservation of natural resources, therefore,
resolves itself into the philosophy of
saving, while at the same time making the
most and best progress in our own day. We
have not developed much consciousness of saving
when we deal with things that come free to
our hands, as the sunshine, the rain, the forests,
the mines, the streams, the earth; and the
American has found himself so much in the
midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
 of plenty that saving has seemed to him
to be parsimony, or at least beneath his attention.
As a question of morals, however,
conscientious saving represents a very high development.
No man has a right to waste, both
because the materials in the last analysis are not
his own, and because some one else may need
what he wastes. A high sense of saving ought
to come out of the conservation movement.
This will make directly for character-efficiency,
since it will develop both responsibility and
regard for others.</p>

<p>The irrigation and dry-farming developments
have a significance far beyond their value in
the raising of crops: they are making the people
to be conservators of water, and to have a
real care for posterity.</p>

<p>Civilization, thus far, is built on the process
of waste. Materials are brought from forest,
and sea, and mine, certain small parts are used,
and the remainder is destroyed <a href="#Page_20">(page 20)</a>; more
labor is wasted than is usefully productive; but
what is far worse, the substance of the land is
taken in unimaginable measure, and dumped
wholesale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
 into endless sewer and drainage systems.
It would seem as if the human race
were bent on finding a process by which
it can most quickly ravish the earth and
make it incapable of maintaining its teeming
millions. We are rapidly threading the country
with vast conduits by which the fertility of
the land can flow away unhindered into the
unreachable reservoirs of the seas.</p>


<h3><a name="The_conservation_of_food" id="The_conservation_of_food"></a><i>The conservation of food.</i></h3>

<p>The fundamental problem for the human
race is to feed itself. It has been a relatively
easy matter to provide food and clothing thus
far, because the earth yet has a small population,
and because there have always been new
lands to be brought into requisition. We shall
eliminate the plagues and the devastations of
war, and the population of the earth will tremendously
increase in the centuries to come.
When the new lands have all been opened to
cultivation, and when thousands of millions
of human beings occupy the earth, the demand
for food will constitute a problem which we
scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
 apprehend to-day. We shall then be
obliged to develop self-sustaining methods of
maintaining the producing-power of land.</p>

<p>We think we have developed intensive and
perfected systems of agriculture; but as a matter
of fact, and speaking broadly, a permanent
organized agriculture is yet unknown. In
certain regions, as in Great Britain, the producing-power
of the land has been increased over
a long series of years, but this has been accomplished
to a great extent by the transportation
of fertilizing materials from the ends of
the earth. The fertility of England has been
drawn largely from the prairies and plains of
America, from which it has secured its food
supplies, from the guano deposits in islands of
the seas, from the bones of men in Egypt and
the battlefields of Europe.</p>

<p>We begin to understand how it is possible to
maintain the producing-power of the surface of
the earth, and there are certain regions in which
our knowledge has been put effectively into
operation, but we have developed no conscious
plan or system in a large way for securing this
result.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
 It is the ultimate problem of the race
to devise a permanent system of agriculture.
It is the greatest question that can confront
mankind; and the question is yet all unsolved.</p>


<h3><a name="The_best_husbandry_is_not_in_the_new_regions" id="The_best_husbandry_is_not_in_the_new_regions"></a><i>The best husbandry is not in the new regions.</i></h3>

<p>The best agriculture, considered in reference
to the permanency of its results, develops in
old regions, where the skinning process has
passed, where the hide has been sold, and
where people come back to utilize what is left.
The skinning process is proceeding at this
minute in the bountiful new lands of the
United States; and in parts of the older states,
and even also in parts of the newer ones, not
only the skin but the tallow has been sold.</p>

<p>We are always seeking growing-room, and
we have found it. But now the Western civilization
has met the Eastern, and the world is
circumferenced. We shall develop the tropics
and push far toward the poles; but we have
now fairly discovered the island that we call the
earth, and we must begin to make the most of it.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
<a name="Another_philosophy_of_agriculture" id="Another_philosophy_of_agriculture"></a><i>Another philosophy of agriculture.</i></h3>

<p>Practically all our agriculture has been developed
on a rainfall basis. There is ancient
irrigation experience, to be sure, but the great
agriculture of the world has been growing away
from these regions. Agriculture is still moving
on, seeking new regions; and it is rapidly invading
regions of small rainfall.</p>

<p>About six-tenths of the land surface of the
globe must be farmed, if farmed at all, under
some system of water-saving. Of this, about
one-tenth is redeemable by irrigation, and the
remainder by some system of utilization of
deficient rainfall, or by what is inappropriately
known as dry-farming. The complementary
practices of irrigation and dry-farming will develop
a wholly new scheme of agriculture and
a new philosophy of country life <a href="#Page_44">(page 44)</a>.</p>

<p>Even in heavy rainfall countries there is often
such waste of water from run-off that the lands
suffer severely from droughts. No doubt the
hilly lands of our best farming regions are greatly
reduced in their crop-producing power because
people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
 do not prepare against drought as consciously
as they provide against frost <a href="#Page_52">(page 52)</a>.
It is often said that we shall water Eastern
lands by irrigation, and I think that we shall;
but our first obligation is to save the rainfall
water by some system of farm-management or
dry-farming.</p>

<p>Agriculture rests on the saving of water.</p>


<h3><a name="The_obligation_of_the_farmer" id="The_obligation_of_the_farmer"></a><i>The obligation of the farmer.</i></h3>

<p>The farmer is rapidly beginning to realize
his obligation to society. It is usual to say
that the farmer feeds the world, but the larger
fact is that he saves the world.</p>

<p>The economic system depends on him.
Wall Street watches the crops.</p>

<p>As cities increase proportionately in population,
the farmer assumes greater relative importance,
and he becomes more and more a
marked man.</p>

<p>Careful and scientific husbandry is rising in
this new country. We have come to a realization
of the fact that our resources are not unlimited.
The mining of fertilizing materials
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
 transportation to a few spots on the earth
will some day cease. We must make the farming
sustain itself, at the same time that it provides
the supplies for mankind.</p>

<p>We all recognize the necessity of the other
great occupations to a well-developed civilization;
but in the nature of the case, the farmer
is the final support. On him depends the existence
of the race. No method of chemical
synthesis can provide us with the materials of
food and clothing and shelter, and with all the
good luxuries that spring from the bosom of
the earth.</p>

<p>I know of no better conservators than our
best farmers. They feel their responsibility.
Quite the ideal of conservation is illustrated by
a farmer of my acquaintance who saves every
product of his land and has developed a system
of self-enriching live-stock husbandry, who has
harnessed his small stream to light his premises
and do much of his work, who turns his drainage
waters into productive uses, and who is now
troubled that he cannot make some use of the
winds that are going to waste on his farm.</p>


<h3><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<a name="The_obligation_of_the_conservation_movement" id="The_obligation_of_the_conservation_movement"></a><i>The obligation of the conservation movement.</i></h3>

<p>What I have meant to impress is the fact
that the farmer is the ultimate conservator of
the resources of the earth. He is near the
cradle of supplies, near the sources of streams,
next the margin of the forests, on the hills and
in the valleys and on the plains just where the
resources lie. He is in contact with the original
and raw materials. Any plan of conservation
that overlooks this fact cannot meet the situation.
The conservation movement must help
the farmer to keep and save the race.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="PERSONAL_SUGGESTIONS" id="PERSONAL_SUGGESTIONS"></a>PERSONAL SUGGESTIONS</h2>


<p>In the preceding pages I have tried to develop
the reader's point of view. To do this,
I have gone over very briefly some of the questions
that are now actively under discussion.
There are other matters, of a more personal
nature, that need to be discussed, or at least
mentioned, in connection with even a sketchy
consideration of the country-life movement;
and some of these I now place together in a
closing budget.</p>


<h3><a name="The_open_country_must_solve_its_own_problems" id="The_open_country_must_solve_its_own_problems"></a><i>The open country must solve its own problems.</i></h3>

<p>It may first be said that the reconstruction
of the open country must depend in the main
on the efforts of the country people themselves.
We are glad of all interchange of populations;
the influx of country blood has thus far been
invaluable to cities; the outgo of city people
has set new aspirations into the country, and
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
 is still necessary to call on the cities for labor
in times of pressure: but stated in its large
terms, the open country will rise no higher
than the aspirations of the people who live
there, and the problems must be solved in such
way that they will meet the conditions as they
exist on the spot.</p>


<h3><a name="Profitable_farming_is_not_a_sufficient_object_in_life" id="Profitable_farming_is_not_a_sufficient_object_in_life"></a><i>Profitable farming is not a sufficient object in
life.</i></h3>

<p>It may then be said that it is the first duty
of every man to earn a decent living for himself
and those dependent on him; and a countryman
cannot expect to have much influence
on his time and community until he makes his
farm pay in dollars and cents.</p>

<p>But the final object in life is not to make
money, but to use money in developing a higher
type of endeavor and a better neighborhood.
The richest farming regions do not necessarily
have the best society or even the best living
conditions. Social usefulness must become a
fact in country districts. The habit of life in
the usual farm family is to take everything to
itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
 and to keep it. Standards of service
must take the place of standards of property.</p>


<h3><a name="New_country_professions" id="New_country_professions"></a><i>New country professions.</i></h3>

<p>The country-life movement does not imply
that all young persons who hereafter shall remain
in the country are to be actual farmers.
The practice of customary professions and occupations
will take on more importance in country
districts. The country physician, veterinary,
pastor, lawyer, and teacher are to extend
greatly in influence and opportunity.</p>

<p>But aside from all this, entirely new occupations
and professions are to arise, even the
names of which are not yet known to us.
Some of them are already under way. There
will be established out in the open country
plant doctors, plant-breeders, soil experts,
health experts, pruning and spraying experts,
forest experts, farm machinery experts, drainage
and irrigation experts, recreation experts,
market experts, and many others. There will
be housekeeping experts or supervisors.
There will be need for overseers of affiliated
organizations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
 and stock companies. These
will all be needed for the purpose of giving
special advice and direction <a href="#Page_78">(page 78)</a>. We
shall be making new applications of rural law,
of business methods for agricultural regions,
new types of organization. The people will
find that it will pay to support such professions
or agents as these.</p>

<p>Country life will become more complex as
rapidly as it becomes more efficient.</p>


<h3><a name="The_personal_resources" id="The_personal_resources"></a><i>The personal resources.</i></h3>

<p>The attitude toward one's world has much
to do both with his effectiveness and with his
satisfaction in living; and this is specially true
with the farmer, because he is so much alone
and has so few conventional sources of entertainment.
It may be important to provide
new entertainment for the farmer; but it is
much more important to develop his personal
resources.</p>

<p>The simple life, as Pastor Wagner so well
explains, is a state of mind. It is a simplification
of desire, a certain directness of effort
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
 of purpose that brings us quickly to a
result, and such an attitude that we derive our
satisfactions from the humble and the near-at-hand.
The countryman is the man who has
the personal touch with his environment.</p>

<p>With the increasing differentiation of country
life, it is of the first importance that the country
people do not lose their simplicity of desires.</p>


<h3><a name="The_meaning_of_the_environment" id="The_meaning_of_the_environment"></a><i>The meaning of the environment.</i></h3>

<p>It is too little appreciated that every natural
object makes a twofold appeal to the human
mind: its appeal in the terms of its physical
or material uses, and its appeal to our sense
of beauty and of personal satisfaction. As
the people progresses in evolution, the public
mind becomes constantly more sensitive to the
conditions in which we live, and the appeal to
the spiritual satisfaction of life constantly
becomes stronger. Not only shall the physical
needs of life be met, but the earth will
constantly be made a more satisfactory place
in which to live.</p>

<p>We must not only save our forests in order
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
 they may yield timber and conserve our
water supplies, but also that they may adorn
and dominate the landscape and contribute to
the meaning of scenery. It is important that
our coal supplies be conserved not only for
their use in manufacture and the arts, but also
that smoke does not vitiate the atmosphere and
render it unhealthful, and discolor the objects
in the landscape. It is of the greatest importance
that water supplies be conserved by
storage reservoirs and other means, but this
conservation should be accomplished in such a
way as not to menace health or offend the eye
or destroy the beauty of contiguous landscape.
The impounding of waters without regard to
preserving natural water-falls, streams, and other
scenery, is a mark of a commercial and selfish
age, and is a procedure that cannot be tolerated
in a highly developed society. It is important
that regulations be enacted regarding the operation
of steam roads through woody districts, not
only that the timber may be saved, but also
that the natural beauty of the landscape may
be protected from fire and other forms of
destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
 The fertility of the soil must be
saved, not only that products may be raised
with which to feed and clothe the people, but
also that the beauty of thrifty and productive
farms may be saved to the landscape. The
property-right in natural scenery is a tenure of
the people, and the best conservation of natural
resources is impossible until this fact is
recognized.</p>

<p>On this point the Commission on Country
Life makes the following statement: "In estimating
our natural resources we must not forget
the value of scenery. This is a distinct
asset, and it will be more recognized as time
goes on. It will be impossible to develop a
satisfactory country life without conserving all
the beauty of landscape and developing the
people to the point of appreciating it. In parts
of the East, a regular system of parking the
open country of the entire state is already
begun, constructing the roads, preserving the
natural features, and developing the latent
beauty in such a way that the whole country
becomes part of one continuing landscape treatment.
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
 in no way interferes with the
agricultural utilization of the land, but rather
increases it. The scenery is, in fact, capitalized,
so that it adds to the property values and contributes
to local patriotism and to the thrift of
the commonwealth."</p>


<h3><a name="Historic_monuments" id="Historic_monuments"></a><i>Historic monuments.</i></h3>

<p>The general tendency of our time is to dump
everything into the cities, particularly into the
large cities. It is there that we assemble our
treasures of art, our libraries, our dramatic
skill, our specimens of statuary and architecture;
and it is there that the aspiring men also
assemble to work out their destinies. And yet
there have been events in the open country.
Great men have lived there. Things have
come to pass. We should be interested to
record these events of the rural country, as
well as the events that are associated with the
congested city. Persons of quickened intelligence
will not live contentedly in the outer
country if it provides nothing more than subsistence.
Every new memorial in the farming
country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
 is one additional reason for people to
live there.</p>

<p>The open country as well as the city has a
history; but one would not discover the fact
from monuments that he may see.</p>

<p>It may not be possible now to erect elaborate
monuments far in the country to commemorate
historical events, but records may be made, and
it is at least possible to roll up a pile of stones.</p>


<h3><a name="Improvement_societies" id="Improvement_societies"></a><i>Improvement societies.</i></h3>

<p>Of late years there has sprung up a line of
societies in villages and small cities whose
province it is to create public sentiment for the
betterment of the place in general good looks,
and which, for lack of a better name, are generally
collectively known as "village improvement
societies." These organizations have
had much effect in making the villages attractive.
Their influence extends far and wide,
but the organization itself in any case ought to
take in all the surrounding territory, with the
purpose to secure a co√∂perative action between
town and country <a href="#Page_122">(page 122)</a>. The entire
region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
 not city or town alone, should be organized.</p>

<p>In many rural communities, there could
well be an open-country improvement society;
or an organization might be formed, from the
church or otherwise, to care for a particular
interest, as the school ground or the cemetery.
The average country cemetery particularly
needs attention.</p>

<p>The care of all the public or semi-public
property of a township or a neighborhood is
somebody's responsibility, and this responsibility
should be recognized in organization.
The pride of the community could be greatly
stimulated if a group of people should associate
to look after roadsides, lake shores and river
banks, waste places, deserted and dilapidated
buildings, weeds, raw spots, paths, dangerous
places, mosquito ponds, breeding places of insects,
stray dogs, horse sheds, trees, birds, wild
flowers, telegraph and telephone depredations,
cemeteries, church grounds, school grounds,
almshouse grounds, picnic grounds, historic
places, patriotic events, bits of good scenery,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
 to give advice on lawns, back-yards and
barn-yards, advertising signs.</p>


<h3><a name="Entertainment" id="Entertainment"></a><i>Entertainment.</i></h3>

<p>All persons seem to be agreed that more
entertainment and recreation should be provided
for country residents; but it does not
follow that vaudeville, and the usual line of
moving pictures, and the traveling concert
would add anything really worth while, although
these are often recommended by town
folk. The Board Walk kind of pageant may
very well be left at the sea-shore.</p>

<p>But we certainly need entertainment that
will help country people over the hard and
dry places, and raise their lives out of monotony.
The guiding principles are two: an
entertainment that shall express the best that
there is in country life; one that shall set the
people themselves at work to produce it, rather
than to bring it in bodily from the outside.</p>

<p>I would not eliminate good things merely
because they come from the outside, and no
one would deny the countryman the touch
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
 any of the masterpieces; but I am speaking
now of a form of effort that shall quicken
an entire country district and leave a permanent
impression on it. I would rather leave
the situation as it is than to introduce the
meaningless performances of the city thoroughfare
and the resorts.</p>

<p>The movement to provide new and better
sports, games, and general recreation is now
well under way, and I do not need to explain
it here; but two things ought to begin to receive
attention: music and drama.</p>

<p>The <a name="music_spirit" id="music_spirit"></a><i>music spirit</i> seems to be dying out in
the country. I hear very little joyous song
there, even though the people may be joyous.
The habit of self-expression in song and music
needs much to be encouraged in home and
school and grange and church. I think the lack
is in part due to the over-mastering influence
of professional town music, and in part to
the absence of study of simple country forms.
Simplicity is not now the fashion in music.
The single player with a simple theme and
the single singer with a melodious and untrilled
strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
 are not much heard at gatherings
now. Some of the best singing I hear is now
and then out among the folk,&mdash;a simple direct
song as plain and sweet as a bird's note. I
hope we shall not lose it.</p>

<p>A <a name="drama" id="drama"></a><i>drama</i> of some kind is very much needed
for country districts. It should be a new form,
something in the way of representing the end
of the planting, the harvest, the seasons, the
leading crops, the dairy, the woods, the history
and traditions of the neighborhood or the
region. Many of the pieces should be acted
out of doors, and they should be produced
chiefly by local talent. Such simple plays for
the most part need yet to be written, but the
themes are numerous. Why not have a festival
or a generous spectacle of Indian corn, and
then fill the whole occasion full of the feeling
of the corn? As pure entertainment, this
would be worth any number of customary
theatricals, and as a means of bringing out the
talent of the community it would have very
positive social value. The traveling play
usually leaves nothing behind it.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
 themes for short, simple, and strong
dramatic presentation are almost numberless,&mdash;such
episodes and events, for example, as the
plowing, the reaping, the husking, the horse-shoeing,
the hay-stacking, the wood-chopping,
the threshing, the sugaring, the raising of the
barn, the digging of the well, the herding of
the cattle, the felling of the tree, the building
of the church, the making of the wagon, the
bridging of the creek, the constructing of the
boat, the selling of the farm, the Indians, the
settlers, the burst of spring, the dead of winter,
the season of bloom, the heyday of summer.</p>

<p>We do not sufficiently appreciate how widespread
and native is the desire to dramatize.
The ritual of fraternal orders is an illustration.
We see it in the charades of evening parties.
The old school "exhibition" made a wonderful
appeal. Every community likes to see its
own people "take parts." At nearly every important
grange meeting, and at other country
meetings, some one must "recite," and the recitation
usually has characters, situations, and
"take-offs." It is too bad that we do not have
better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
 literature to put in the hands of these
reciters; in the meantime, I hope that the custom
will not die out.</p>

<p>One who has seen the consummate Passion
Play at Oberammergau must have had the
thought impressed on him that there is much
latent talent among the country folk, and also
that it is much worth the while of a community
to develop this talent. Aside from its transcendent
theme, this stupendous play appeals
to the world because of its simplicity and directness
and because of its reality, for these are
the very kind of folk that might have taken
part in the mighty drama had the Great Master
lived in Oberammergau.</p>

<p>The nativeness of the play impresses one.
The very absence of so much that we associate
with the ordinary drama gives the play an
appeal,&mdash;the absence of the studied stride and
strut, of the exaggerated make-ups, and of
the over-doing of the parts. The play is
grounded in the lives of the people in the
community.</p>

<p>We cannot expect another place to become
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
 Oberammergau, but it is possible for something
good to come out of any spot. This
thought is vividly expressed by W. T. Stead
in his account of the Passion Play:</p>

<p>"As I write, it is now two days after the
Passion Play. The crowd has departed, the
village is once more quiet and still. The swallows
are twittering in the eaves, the blue and
cloudless sky over-arches the amphitheater of
hills. All is peace, and the whole dramatic
troupe pursue with equanimity the even tenor
of their ordinary life. Most of the best players
are woodcarvers; the others are peasants or
local tradesmen. Their royal robes or their
rabbinical costumes laid aside, they go about
their ordinary work in the ordinary way as ordinary
mortals. But what a revelation it is of
the mine of latent capacity, musical, dramatic,
intellectual, in the human race, that a single
mountain village can furnish, under a capable
guidance, and with adequate inspiration, such a
host competent to set forth such a play from
its tinkers, tailors, plowmen, bakers, and the
like! It is not native capacity that is lacking
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
 mankind. It is the guiding brain, the patient
love, the careful education, and the stimulus
and inspiration of a great idea. But, given these,
every village of country yokels from Dorset to
Caithness might develop artists as noble and
as devoted as those of Oberammergau."</p>


<h3><a name="The_business_of_farming" id="The_business_of_farming"></a><i>The business of farming.</i></h3>

<p>After all is said and done, the first question
still remains,&mdash;the opportunity to make a good
living on a farm, and the possibility of leading
a life that will be personally satisfactory.</p>

<p>There has never been a time when farming
as a whole has been so prosperous as now, notwithstanding
the fact that there are hardships
in many regions. The whole occupation is
undergoing a process of readjustment, and it is
natural that the readjustment has become more
complete and perfect in some places and in
some kinds of farming than in others. We
have but recently passed through a time in
which the farming business, except in special
regions or special cases, could not be really
profitable and attractive.</p>

<p>To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
 make a good and satisfactory living on
the farm is a matter both of temperament and
of first-class training. There are great series
of city vocations in which any person with fair
ability can succeed; but farming is a personal
business and each man is his own manager. No
one should ever go into farming impersonally.</p>

<p>Many persons are making a comfortable living
on farms, a better living in fact than persons
of similar ability and expending similar energy
are making in town. Other persons are failing.</p>

<p>I am not advising anybody to establish himself
in the open country; but I am saying that
the time has now come when good talent need
not avoid the open country.</p>

<p>This is a good time for the well-trained farm-minded
young man or woman to go into agriculture;
but one should be sure that he has
the qualifications.</p>

<p>There is no need that farming provide only
a narrow and deadening life. One may express
there all the resources of a good education.</p>

<p>The college man is now beginning to affect
the sentiment and the practice in rural communities.
Formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
 a college man going back to
the farm was likely to be the subject of distrust
and even ridicule. This attitude is passing
very rapidly in the good rural regions.</p>

<p>In his public relations, most of the ambition
of the countryman has been to hold office. It
is a form of small political entertainment, too
often with no thought of any particular service
to the community. We have a wholly distorted
idea of the "honor" of holding office; there is
no honor in an office unless it contributes something
worth while to society. We cannot expect
strong leadership to develop in the open
country until there are better things to look
forward to than merely to hold the small political
places. Many opportunities for rendering
prominent public service will now arise in the
farm country; perhaps this book will suggest
a few of them. And it ought to be some satisfaction
to a young man or woman to know that
he or she is part of a world-movement, and
to feel that it is no longer necessary to explain
or to apologize for being a countryman
or a farmer.</p>

<p>We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
 have been living in a get-rich-quick age.
Persons have wanted to make fortunes. Our
business enterprises are organized with that end
in view. Persons are now asking how they
may live a satisfactory life, rather than placing
the whole emphasis on the financial turnover
of a business. There is greater need of more
good farmers than of more millionaires.</p>

<p>My reader may wish to know what constitutes
a good farmer. I think that the requirements
of a good farmer are at least four:</p>

<p>The ability to make a full and comfortable
living from the land;</p>

<p>to rear a family carefully and well;</p>

<p>to be of good service to the community;</p>

<p>to leave the farm more productive than it
was when he took it.</p>
